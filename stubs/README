1. Introduction
---------------

This  is a  collection of  small C  language  libraries; its
purpose  is  to  adapt  the  C  interface  to  some  foreign
libraries'  features   to  be  usable  by   the  Scheme  FFI
libraries.

  Building  and installation  of  all the  libraries can  be
enabled  or  disabled with  a  command  line  option to  the
"configure"  script.    The  list  of   available  libraries
follows.

Library name:	libnausicaa-posix.so
Enable option:	--enable-posix
Disable option:	--disable-posix

  Implements  an interface to  the preprocessor  macros that
  allows inspection of the status returned by "waitpid()".

4. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd stubs
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-stubs

  The "Makefile" mostly supports the packages infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
