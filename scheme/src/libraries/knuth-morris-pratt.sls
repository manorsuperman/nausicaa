;;;Copyright details
;;;=================
;;;
;;;The prefix/suffix and comparison routines in this code had (extremely
;;;distant) origins  in MIT Scheme's  string lib, and  was substantially
;;;reworked by  Olin Shivers (shivers@ai.mit.edu)  9/98. As such,  it is
;;;covered by MIT Scheme's open source copyright. See below for details.
;;;
;;;The KMP string-search code  was influenced by implementations written
;;;by Stephen  Bevan, Brian Dehneyer and Will  Fitzgerald. However, this
;;;version was written from scratch by myself.
;;;
;;;The remainder  of this  code was written  from scratch by  myself for
;;;scsh.  The scsh  copyright is a BSD-style open  source copyright. See
;;;below for details.
