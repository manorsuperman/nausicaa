;;;Date: Mon Dec 27, 2010
;;;
;;;Abstract
;;;
;;;	This  library handles  search trees  in which  keys are  list of
;;;	Scheme  symbols and  values can  be anything;  the tree  has the
;;;	structure of  nested alists.   Inserting the following  keys and
;;;	values (in this order):
;;;
;;;         (a b1 c1 d1)	1
;;;         (a b1 c1 d2)	2
;;;         (a b1 c2 d1)	1
;;;         (a b1 c1 d3)	3
;;;         (a b2 c1)		4
;;;         (a b1 c2 d2)	2
;;;         (a b2 c2)		5
;;;         (a b1 c2 d3)	3
;;;         (a b2 c3)		6
;;;         (a b2)		7
;;;         (a b1 c2)		8
;;;
;;;	yields the following tree:
;;;
;;;	    ((a . ((b2 . ((#f . 7)
;;;                       (c3 . ((#f . 6)))
;;;                       (c2 . ((#f . 5)))
;;;                       (c1 . ((#f . 4)))))
;;;                (b1 . ((c2 . ((#f . 8)
;;;                              (d3 . ((#f . 3)))
;;;                              (d2 . ((#f . 2)))
;;;                              (d1 . ((#f . 1)))))
;;;                       (c1 . ((d3 . ((#f . 3)))
;;;                              (d2 . ((#f . 2)))
;;;                              (d1 . ((#f . 1))))))))))
;;;
;;;     notice  that keys  are stored  as sequences  ending with  a pair
;;;     having #f  as key, and such  pairs are kept at  the beginning of
;;;     the alist.
;;;
;;;	Storing a key/value pair whose key already exists causes the old
;;;	value to be overwritten.

;;;; iteration documentation

#| In the next code page  we implement the iteration of the the elements
of a  tree; here we explain how  it goes.  Iterating over  a tree means;
composing a sequence of keys and values; for the following simple tree:

    ((#f . 1)
     (a . ((#f . 2)))
     (b . ((c1 . ((#f . 3)))
           (c2 . ((#f . 4))))))

iterating means generating the following sequence of key/value couples:

    ()		1
    (a)		2
    (b c1)	3
    (b c3)	4

for  implementation reasons the  iterator returns  the keys  as reversed
lists:

    ()		1
    (a)		2
    (c1 b)	3
    (c3 b)	4

but this is not a big problem.

An iteration has a state composed  of a stack of subtrees and a reversed
key.  For the tree:

    ((#f . 1)
     (a . ((#f . 2)))
     (b . ((c1 . ((#f . 3)))
           (c2 . ((#f . 4))))))

it goes as follows:

* Initialisation:

    rkey  = []
    stack = [((#f . 1) (a . ...) (b . ...))]

* Depth first search until #f key is found:

    rkey  = []
    stack = [((#f . 1) (a . ...) (b . ...))]

  store the key and value, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = () 1
    rkey    = []
    stack   = [((a . ((#f . 2))) (b . ...))]

  return the results.

* Depth first search until #f key is found:

    rkey  = [a]
    stack = [((#f . 2))
             ((a . ((#f . 2))) (b . ...))]

  store the key and value, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = (a) 2
    rkey  = [a]
    stack = [()
             ((a . ((#f . 2))) (b . ...))]

  back track, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = (a) 2
    rkey  = []
    stack = [((b . ((c1 . ((#f . 3))) (c2 . ...))))]

  return the results.

* Depth first search until #f key is found:

    rkey  = [c1 b]
    stack = [((#f . 3))
             ((c1 . ((#f . 3))) (c2 . ...))
             ((b . ((c1 . ((#f . 3))) (c2 . ...))))]

  store the key and value, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = (c1 b) 3
    rkey    = [c1 b]
    stack   = [()
               ((c1 . ((#f . 3))) (c2 . ...))
               ((b . ((c1 . ((#f . 3))) (c2 . ...))))]

  back track, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = (c1 b) 3
    rkey    = [b]
    stack   = [((c2 . ((#f . 4))))
               ((b . ((c1 . ((#f . 3))) (c2 . ...))))]

  return the results.

* Depth first search until #f key is found:

    rkey    = [c2 b]
    stack   = [((#f . 4))
               ((c2 . ((#f . 4))))
               ((b . ((c1 . ...) (c2 . ((#f . 4))))))]

  store the key and value, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = (c2 b) 4
    rkey    = [c2 b]
    stack   = [()
               ((c2 . ((#f . 4))))
               ((b . ((c1 . ...) (c2 . ((#f . 4))))))]

  back track, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = (c2 b) 4
    rkey    = [b]
    stack   = [()
               ((b . ((c1 . ...) (c2 . ((#f . 4))))))]

  back track, pop the caar from the stack:

    results = (c2 b) 4
    rkey    = []
    stack   = [()]

  back track:

    results = (c2 b) 4
    rkey    = []
    stack   = []

  return the results.
