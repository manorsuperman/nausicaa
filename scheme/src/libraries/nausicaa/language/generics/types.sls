;;;Contents: customisable type interface for generics library
;;;Date: Mon Jan 17, 2011
;;;
;;;Abstract
;;;
;;;	We need to export four bindings:
;;;
;;;	UID-LIST - A syntax which, applied to a type identifier, expands
;;;	into  a list  of symbols  representing the  type  hierarchy from
;;;	subclass to parent class.  All  the expansions of this macro for
;;;	the same  identifier must  yield the same  list in the  sense of
;;;	EQ?.
;;;
;;;	UID-LIST-OF - A function which,  applied to any value, returns a
;;;	list of symbols representing the type hierarchy from subclass to
;;;	parent  class.    The  returned  value  must  be   EQ?   to  the
;;;	corresponding expansion of UID-LIST.
;;;
;;;	METHOD-LAMBDA  -  A  syntax  which  must work  like  LAMBDA  but
;;;	recognise arguments tagged with types.
;;;
;;;	top - An identifier representing the topmost parent type for all
;;;	the classes.
