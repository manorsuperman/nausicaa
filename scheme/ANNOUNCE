		      Nausicaa/Scheme
		      ===============


Nausicaa is a distribution  of Scheme language libraries for
R6RS  Scheme  implementations.   Currently  it  attempts  to
support Ikarus, Larceny, Mosh, Petite Chez and Ypsilon.

  Nausicaa/Scheme   is  the   core   package;  it   provides
foundation  libraries and  implements the  infrastructure of
the foreign-functions interface.  It comes in two flavors:

* The  full  distribution,  with documentation  and  foreign
  functions    interface    included.    Its    installation
  infrastructure  requires a  GNU+Linux system  (for details
  see the "README.build" file).

* The pure Scheme distribution, includes only the sources of
  the libraries, ready to  be unpacked in their installation
  destination.

  The  latest  release  of  the Nausicaa/Scheme  package  is
available at:

     <http://github.com/marcomaggi/nausicaa/downloads>

the home page of the Nausicaa project is at:

development takes place at:

Notes for --- tag 0.2a0
-------------------------------

* Added WITH-ACCESSOR-AND-MUTATOR to (language-extensions).

* Removed the (records) library.  Replaced it with (classes)
  and (generics).

* Added DEFINE-CONDITION to (conditions).

* Reorganised  the   (nausicaa)  library:  more  independent
  component   libraries;   added   (classes)  stuff,   added
  (conditions) stuff.

* Added use of (classes) to several libraries.

* Reorganised FFI libraries, removed "foreign" prefix.

* Removed (sexps syntax) library.

* Further cleanup of (matches) internals.

* Started  use  of  labels  from (classes)  as  wrappers  of
  foreign C  structures, allowing access of  fields with dot
  notation.


Notes for 2010-03-28 tag 0.1a11
-------------------------------

* Updated to IrRegex version 0.8.1.

* Added POINTER-DECR! to (foreign ffi pointers).

* Added bits  of FFI support for Petite  Chez, not involving
  FOREIGN-PROCEDURE and FOREIGN-CALLABLE.

* Renamed  DEFINE-IDENTIFIER-MACRO  in (language-extensions)
  to DEFINE-IDENTIFIER-ACCESSOR-MUTATOR.

* Added  DEFINE-CONSTANT, IDENTIFIER-SYNTAX-ACCESSOR-MUTATOR
  to (language-extensions).

* Added   DEFINE-WITH-STRUCT  and   DEFINE-STRUCT-FIELDS  to
  (foreign ffi utilities).

* Improved  (foreign  ffi  inspector-maker)  infrastructure.
  This will cause waterfall update of all the packages.


Notes for 2010-03-15 tag 0.1a10
-------------------------------

* Updated    ikarus.texi   with   material    from   project
  ikscheme-manual at  GitHub.  Added documentation  for post
  GC hooks.

* Added  ASCII  armor  libraries:  base16,  base32,  base64,
  base91, ASCII85, quoted-printable.

* Added   WHILE,  DO-WHILE,  INCR!,   DECR!,  DEFINE-VALUES,
  DEFINE-INLINE  syntaxes to  (language-extensions).  Merged
  in   (language-extensions)    the   libraries:   (begin0),
  (set-cons), (receive).  This has caused a waterfall update
  of other packages.

* Changed the  (keywords) library so that  it uses KEYWORD=?
  to compare  objects.  Propagated the changes  to the other
  libraries.

* Removed  the COND-EXPAND features  with the  exception of:
  linux-gnu, r6rs and the implementation identifiers.

* Updated  (irregex)  to IrRegex  version  0.8.0.  This  has
  minor  incompatibilities  (example:  the return  value  of
  IRREGEX-OPT).

* Removed   OPEN-SHARED-OBJECT*  and  LOOKUP-SHARED-OBJECT*;
  changed  OPEN-SHARED-OBJECT  and  LOOKUP-SHARED-OBJECT  to
  raise  exceptions; improved  their error  message; changed
  types or related condition objects.

* Added non-FFI support for  Petite Chez Scheme (tested with
  version 7.9.4).


Notes for 2010-01-14 tag 0.1a9
------------------------------

* Removed   from  the   infrastructure   rules  to   install
  precompiled files.

* Added '#f  #t' optional  arguments to DLOPEN  in "(foreign
  ffi  platform)" for  Ikarus; this  allows  loading certain
  shared  libraries   with  dependencies  on   other  shared
  libraries.

* Fixed problem in the building infrastructure.


Notes for 2010-01-05 tag 0.1a8
------------------------------

* Fixed bugs.

* Added the (enumerations) library.


Notes for 2009-12-02 tag 0.1a7
------------------------------

* Changed <memblock> fields from immutable to mutable; added
  functions to (foreign memory memblocks).

* Reorganised the FFI.


Notes for 2009-11-26 tag 0.1a6
------------------------------

* Added inspector maker library.


Notes for 2009-11-19 tag 0.1a5
------------------------------

* Updated FFI  to Mosh Scheme revision  2187, which provides
  the full  set of Scheme-to-C callout  arguments and return
  values.

* Added dictionary and string/number comparison functions.


Notes for 2009-11-15 tag 0.1a4
------------------------------

* Small miscellaneous fixes and improvements.


Notes for 2009-11-13 tag 0.1a3
------------------------------

* Added the (getopts) library.

* Removed usage  of WITH-FIELDS and similar  macros, to make
  all the libraries in the base package serialisable.

* In the  (nausicaa) language, changed the  behaviour of MAX
  and * under Ypsilon and  of MAX under Ikarus to return NaN
  when one of the operands is NaN.


Notes for 2009-11-01 tag 0.1a2
------------------------------

* Updated to work with Mosh revision 2171.

* Fixed   miscellaneous   bugs   in  the   foreign-functions
  interface.

* Larceny    Scheme    officially    unsupported   by    the
  foreign-functions interface.

* Library (format) renamed to (formations).


Notes for 2009-10-20 tag 0.1a0
------------------------------

* This  is  the  first  public  and proper  release  of  the
  Nausicaa/Scheme package.  It  is an alpha quality release,
  meaning  that  bugs exists  and  the  feature  set is  not
  complete, but the libraries are usable.

* The  documentation  is  (to  the  best  of  my  knowledge)
  synchronised, with the exceptions of the (schelog) library
  (whose port is still to do) and the (format) library.

* The   (format)  library  needs   to  be   reorganised  and
  redocumented.

* The  (times-and-dates) library needs  to be  rewritten and
  redocumented.

* The  foreign functions  interface currently  supports only
  GNU+Linux   systems;   its   API   is   almost   complete.
  Unfortunately, support  for callback functions  is missing
  for Larceny Scheme.
