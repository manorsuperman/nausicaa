The @library{nausicaa streams} library implements @dfn{streams};
sometimes called ``lazy lists'', streams are a sequential data structure
containing elements computed only on demand.  A stream is either null or
is a pair with a stream in its cdr.  Since elements of a stream are
computed only when accessed, streams can be infinite.  Once computed,
the value of a stream element is cached in case it is needed again.

@section Basic interface


The basic @api{} provides two mutually--recursive abstract data types:
An object of the @samp{stream} abstract data type is a promise that,
when forced, is either @samp{stream-null} or is an object of type
@samp{stream-pair}.  An object of the @samp{stream-pair} abstract data
type contains a @dfn{kar} and a @dfn{kdr}, which must be a
@samp{stream}.  The essential feature of streams is the systematic
suspensions of the recursive promises between the two data types.

@example
alpha stream
  :: (promise stream-null)
  |  (promise (alpha stream-pair))

alpha stream-pair
  :: (promise alpha) x (promise (alpha stream))
@end example

The object stored in the kar of a @samp{stream-pair} is a promise that
is forced the first time the kar is accessed; its value is cached in
case it is needed again.  The object may have any type, and different
stream elements may have different types.  If the kar is never accessed,
the object stored there is never evaluated.  Likewise, the kdr is a
promise to return a stream, and is only forced on demand.

This @api{} provides eight operators: constructors for
@samp{stream-null} and @samp{stream-pair}, type recognisers for streams
and the two kinds of streams, accessors for both fields of a
@samp{stream-pair}, a lambda that creates procedures that return
streams.


@deffn Constant stream-null
Return a promise that, when forced, is a single object, distinguishable
from all other objects, that represents the null stream.
@func{stream-null} is immutable and unique.
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax stream-cons @var{obj} @var{stream}
Accept an object and a stream and create a newly--allocated stream
containing a promise that, when forced, is a @samp{stream-pair} with the
object in its kar and the stream in its @func{stream-cdr}.

Once created, a @samp{stream-pair} is immutable; there is @strong{no}
@func{stream-set-kar!} or @func{stream-set-kdr!} that modifies an
existing @samp{stream-pair}.  There is no dotted--pair or improper
stream as with lists.
@end deffn


@defun stream? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if @var{obj} is a @samp{stream} and @false{} otherwise.
If @var{obj} is a @samp{stream}, @func{stream?} does not force its
promise.

If @code{(stream? obj)} is @true{}, then one of @code{(stream-null?
obj)} and @code{(stream-pair? obj)} will be @true{} and the other will
be @false{}; if @code{(stream? obj)} is @false{}, both
@code{(stream-null?  obj)} and @code{(stream-pair?  obj)} will be
@false{}.
@end defun


@defun stream-null? @var{obj}
Return @true{} if the @var{obj} is the distinguished null stream and
@false{} otherwise.  If @var{obj} is a @samp{stream},
@func{stream-null?} must force its promise in order to distinguish
@samp{stream-null} from @samp{stream-pair}.
@end defun


@defun stream-pair? @var{obj}
Take an @var{obj} and return @true{} if it is a @samp{stream-pair}
constructed by @func{stream-cons} and @false{} otherwise.  If @var{obj}
is a @samp{stream}, @func{stream-pair?} must force its promise in order
to distinguish @samp{stream-null} from @samp{stream-pair}.
@end defun


@defun stream-car @var{stream}
Return the object stored in the kar of @var{stream}.  @func{stream-car}
signals an error if the object passed to it is not a @samp{stream-pair}.
Calling @func{stream-car} causes the object stored there to be evaluated
if it has not yet been; the object's value is cached in case it is
needed again.
@end defun


@defun stream-cdr @var{stream}
Return the stream stored in the kdr of @var{stream}.  @func{stream-cdr}
signals an error if the object passed to it is not a @samp{stream-pair}.
Calling @func{stream-cdr} does not force the promise containing the
stream stored in the kdr of the stream.
@end defun


@deffn Syntax stream-lambda @var{formals} . @var{body}
Create a procedure that returns a promise to evaluate the body of the
procedure.  The last body expression to be evaluated must yield a
stream.

As with normal @func{lambda}, @var{formals} may be a single variable
name, in which case all the formal arguments are collected into a single
list, or a list of variable names, which may be null if there are no
arguments, proper if there are an exact number of arguments, or dotted
if a fixed number of arguments is to be followed by zero or more
arguments collected into a list.

@var{body} must contain at least one expression, and may contain
internal definitions preceding any expressions to be evaluated.
@end deffn


Examples:

@example
(define strm123
  (stream-cons 1
    (stream-cons 2
      (stream-cons 3
        stream-null))))

(stream-car strm123)
@result{} 1

(stream-car (stream-cdr strm123))
@result{} 2

(stream-pair?
  (stream-cdr
    (stream-cons (/ 1 0) stream-null)))
@result{} #f

(stream? (list 1 2 3))
@result{} #f

(define iter
  (stream-lambda (f x)
    (stream-cons x (iter f (f x)))))

(define nats
  (iter (lambda (x)
          (+ x 1))
        0))

(stream-car (stream-cdr nats))
@result{} 1

(define stream-add
  (stream-lambda (s1 s2)
    (stream-cons
      (+ (stream-car s1) (stream-car s2))
      (stream-add (stream-cdr s1)
                  (stream-cdr s2)))))

(define evens
  (stream-add nats nats))

(stream-car evens)
@result{} 0

(stream-car (stream-cdr evens))
@result{} 2

(stream-car (stream-cdr (stream-cdr evens)))
@result{} 4
@end example

@section Definitions and constructors


@deffn Syntax stream @var{object} ...
Take zero or more objects and create a newly--allocated @samp{stream}
containing in its elements the objects, in order.  Since @func{stream}
is syntactic, the objects are evaluated when they are accessed, not when
the @samp{stream} is created.  If no objects are given, as in
@code{(stream)}, the null stream is returned.  See also
@func{list->stream}.

Example:

@example
(define strm123 (stream 1 2 3))

; (/ 1 0) not evaluated when stream is created
(define s (stream 1 (/ 1 0) -1))
@end example
@end deffn


@defun stream-constant @var{object} ...
Take one or more objects and return a newly--allocated @samp{stream}
containing in its elements the objects, repeating the objects in
succession forever.

Example:

@example
(stream-constant 1)
@result{} 1 1 1 ...

(stream-constant #t #f)
@result{} #t #f #t #f #t #f ...
@end example
@end defun


@deffn Syntax define-stream (@var{name} @var{formals}) . @var{body}
Create a procedure that returns a @samp{stream}, and may appear anywhere
a normal @func{define} may appear, including an internal definition, and
may have internal definitions of its own, including other
@func{define-streams}.  The defined procedure takes arguments in the
same way as @func{stream-lambda}.

@func{define-stream} is syntactic sugar on @func{stream-lambda}; see
also @func{stream-let}.

The following example is a simple version of @func{stream-map} that
takes only a single input stream and calls itself recursively:

@example
(define-stream (stream-map proc strm)
  (if (stream-null? strm)
      stream-null
    (stream-cons
      (proc (stream-car strm))
      (stream-map proc (stream-cdr strm)))))
@end example
@end deffn


@deffn Syntax stream-let @var{name} ((@var{var} @var{expr}) ...) @var{body}
Create a local scope that binds each variable to the value of its
corresponding expression.  Additionally bind @var{name} to a procedure
which takes the bound variables as arguments and @var{body} as its
defining expressions, binding the tag with @func{stream-lambda}.
@var{name} is in scope within @var{body}, and may be called recursively.

When the expanded expression defined by @func{stream-let} is evaluated,
@func{stream-let} evaluates the expressions in its body in an
environment containing the newly--bound variables, returning the value
of the last expression evaluated, which must yield a stream.

@func{stream-let} provides syntactic sugar on @func{stream-lambda}, in
the same manner as normal @func{let} provides syntactic sugar on normal
@func{lambda}.  However, unlike normal @func{let}, the @var{name} is
required, not optional, because unnamed @func{stream-let} is
meaningless.

Example: @func{stream-member} returns the first @samp{stream-pair} of
the input @var{strm} with a kar @var{x} that satisfies @code{(eqv? obj
x)}, or the null stream if @var{x} is not present in @var{strm}.

@example
(define-stream (stream-member eql? obj strm)
  (stream-let loop ((strm strm))
    (cond ((stream-null? strm)
           strm)
          ((eqv? obj (stream-car strm))
           strm)
          (else
           (loop (stream-cdr strm))))))
@end example
@end deffn

@section Converting objects into streams


@defun list->stream @var{list-of-objects}
Return a newly--allocated @samp{stream} containing in its elements the
objects in the list.  Since the objects are given in a list, they are
evaluated when @func{list->stream} is called, before the @samp{stream}
is created.  If the list of objects is null, as in @code{(list->stream
'())}, the null @samp{stream} is returned.  See also @func{stream}.

Example:

@example
(define strm123
  (list->stream '(1 2 3)))

;; fails with divide-by-zero error
(define s
  (list->stream (list 1 (/ 1 0) -1)))
@end example
@end defun


@defun port->stream
@defunx port->stream @var{port}
Return a newly--allocated @samp{stream} containing in its elements the
characters on the @var{port}.  If @var{port} is not given it defaults to
the current input port.  The returned @samp{stream} has finite length
and is terminated by @samp{stream-null}.

It looks like one use of @func{port->stream} would be this:

@example
(define s               ;wrong!
  (with-input-from-file filename
    (lambda ()
      (port->stream))))
@end example

@noindent
but that fails, because @func{with-input-from-file} is eager, and closes
the input port prematurely, before the first character is read.  To read
a file into a stream, use:

@example
(define-stream (file->stream filename)
  (let ((p (open-input-file filename)))
    (stream-let loop ((c (read-char p)))
      (if (eof-object? c)
          (begin (close-input-port p)
                 stream-null)
          (stream-cons c
            (loop (read-char p)))))))
@end example
@end defun

@defun stream->list @var{stream}
@defunx stream->list @var{stream} @var{n}
Take a natural number @var{n} and a @var{stream} and return a
newly--allocated list containing in its elements the first @var{n} items
in the @var{stream}.  If the @var{stream} has less than @var{n} items
all the items in the @var{stream} will be included in the returned list.
If @var{n} is not given it defaults to infinity, which means that unless
@var{stream} is finite @func{stream->list} will never return.

Example:

@example
(stream->list 10
  (stream-map (lambda (x) (* x x))
    (stream-from 0)))
  => (0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81)
@end example
@end defun

@c page
@node streams ops
@section Operations


@defun stream-length @var{stream}
Take an input stream and return the number of elements in the stream; it
does not evaluate its elements.  @func{stream-length} may only be used
on finite streams; it enters an infinite loop with infinite streams.

Example:

@example
(define strm123
  (stream 1 2 3))

(stream-length strm123)
@result{} 3
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-ref @var{stream} @var{n}
Return the @var{n}-th element of @var{stream}, counting from zero.  An
error is signaled if @var{n} is greater than or equal to the length of
@var{stream}.

Example:

@example
(define (fact n)
  (stream-ref
    (stream-scan * 1 (stream-from 1))
    n))
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-reverse @var{stream}
Return a newly--allocated stream containing the elements of the input
@var{stream} but in reverse order.  @func{stream-reverse} may only be
used with finite streams; it enters an infinite loop with infinite
streams.  @func{stream-reverse} does not force evaluation of the
elements of the stream.

@example
(define s (stream 1 (/ 1 0) -1))
(define r (stream-reverse s))

(stream-ref r 0)
(stream-ref r 2)        @result{} 1
(stream-ref r 1)        @error{} division by zero
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-append @var{stream} ...
Return a newly--allocated @samp{stream} containing in its elements those
elements contained in its input streams, in order of input.  If any of
the input streams is infinite, no elements of any of the succeeding
input streams will appear in the output stream; thus, if @var{x} is
infinite, @code{(stream-append x y)} is identical to @var{x}.  See also
@func{stream-concat}.

Example: quicksort can be used to sort a @samp{stream}, using
@func{stream-append} to build the output; the sort is lazy; so if only
the beginning of the output stream is needed, the end of the stream is
never sorted.

@example
(define-stream (qsort lt? strm)
  (if (stream-null? strm)
      stream-null
      (let ((x (stream-car strm))
            (xs (stream-cdr strm)))
        (stream-append
          (qsort lt?
            (stream-filter
              (lambda (u) (lt? u x))
              xs))
          (stream x)
          (qsort lt?
            (stream-filter
              (lambda (u) (not (lt? u x)))
              xs))))))
@end example

Note also that, when used in tail position as in @func{qsort},
@func{stream-append} does not suffer the poor performance of
@func{append} on lists.  The list version of @func{append} requires
re--traversal of all its list arguments except the last each time it is
called.  But @func{stream-append} is different.  Each recursive call to
@func{stream-append} is suspended; when it is later forced, the
preceding elements of the result have already been traversed, so
tail--recursive loops that produce streams are efficient even when each
element is appended to the end of the result stream.  This also implies
that during traversal of the result only one promise needs to be kept in
memory at a time.
@end defun


@defun stream-concat @var{stream}
Take a @var{stream} consisting of one or more streams and return a
newly--allocated stream containing all the elements of the input
streams.  If any of the streams in the input stream is infinite, any
remaining streams in the input stream will never appear in the output
stream.  See also @func{stream-append}.

Example:

@example
(stream->list
  (stream-concat
    (stream
      (stream 1 2) (stream) (stream 3 2 1))))
@result{} (1 2 3 2 1)
@end example

Example: the permutations of a finite stream can be determined by
interleaving each element of the stream in all possible positions within
each permutation of the other elements of the stream; @func{interleave}
returns a stream of streams with @var{x} inserted in each possible
position of @var{yy}:

@example
(define-stream (interleave x yy)
  (stream-match yy
    (() (stream (stream x)))
    ((y .  ys)
      (stream-append
        (stream (stream-cons x yy))
        (stream-map
          (lambda (z) (stream-cons y z))
          (interleave x ys))))))

(define-stream (perms xs)
  (if (stream-null? xs)
      (stream (stream))
    (stream-concat
      (stream-map
        (lambda (ys)
          (interleave (stream-car xs) ys))
        (perms (stream-cdr xs))))))
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-zip @var{stream} ...
Take one or more input streams and return a newly--allocated stream in
which each element is a list (not a stream) of the corresponding
elements of the input streams.  The output stream is as long as the
shortest input stream, if any of the input streams is finite, or is
infinite if all the input streams are infinite.

A common use of @func{stream-zip} is to add an index to a stream, as in:

@example
(stream-finds eqv? obj strm)
@end example

@noindent
which returns all the zero--based indices in @var{strm} at which
@var{obj} appears; @code{(stream-find eqv? obj strm)} returns the first
such index, or @false{} if @var{obj} is not in @var{strm}.

@example
(define-stream (stream-finds item= obj strm)
  (stream-of (car x)
    (x in (stream-zip (stream-from 0) strm))
    (item= obj (cadr x))))

(define (stream-find item= obj strm)
  (stream-car
    (stream-append
      (stream-finds item= obj strm)
      (stream #f))))

(stream-find char=? #\l
  (list->stream
    (string->list "hello")))
@result{} 2

(stream-find char=? #\l
  (list->stream
    (string->list "goodbye")))
@result{} #f
@end example

@func{stream-find} is not as inefficient as it looks; although it calls
@func{stream-finds}, which finds all matching indices, the matches are
computed lazily, and only the first match is needed for
@func{stream-find}.
@end defun

@c page
@node streams select
@section Selecting


@defun stream-drop @var{n} @var{stream}
Return the suffix of the input stream that starts at the next element
after the first @var{n} elements.  The output stream shares structure
with the input stream; thus, promises forced in one instance of the
stream are also forced in the other instance of the stream.  If the
input stream has less than @var{n} elements, @func{stream-drop} returns
the null stream.  See also @func{stream-take}.

Example:

@example
(define (stream-split n strm)
  (values (stream-take n strm)
          (stream-drop n strm)))
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-drop-while @var{pred} @var{stream}
Return the suffix of the input stream that starts at the first element
@var{x} for which @code{(pred x)} is @false{}.  The output stream
shares structure with the input stream.  See also
@func{stream-take-while}.

Example: @func{stream-unique} creates a new stream that retains only the
first of any sub--sequences of repeated elements.

@example
(define-stream (stream-unique item= strm)
  (if (stream-null? strm)
      stream-null
    (stream-cons (stream-car strm)
      (stream-unique item=
        (stream-drop-while
          (lambda (x)
            (item= (stream-car strm) x))
          strm)))))
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-take @var{n} @var{stream}
Take a non--negative exact integer @var{n} and a @var{stream} and return
a newly--allocated stream containing the first @var{n} elements of the
input stream.  If the input stream has less than @var{n} elements, so
does the output stream.  See also @func{stream-drop}.

Example: @func{merge-sort} splits a stream into two equal--length
pieces, sorts them recursively and merges the results:

@example
(define-stream (merge-sort lt? strm)
  (let* ((n     (div (stream-length strm) 2))
         (ts    (stream-take n strm))
         (ds    (stream-drop n strm)))
    (if (zero? n)
        strm
      (stream-merge lt? (merge-sort < ts) (merge-sort < ds)))))
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-take-while @var{pred} @var{stream}
Take a predicate and a stream and return a newly--allocated stream
containing those elements @var{x} that form the maximal prefix of the
input stream for which @code{(pred x)} is non--@false{}.  See also
@func{stream-drop-while}.

@example
(stream-car
  (stream-reverse
    (stream-take-while
      (lambda (x) (< x 1000))
      primes)))
@result{} 997
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-filter @var{pred} @var{stream}
Return a newly--allocated stream that contains only those elements
@var{x} of the input stream for which @code{(pred x)} is true.

Example:

@example
(stream-filter odd? (stream-from 0))
@result{} 1 3 5 7 9 ...
@end example
@end defun

@c page
@node streams range
@section Range streams


@defun stream-from @var{first}
@defunx stream-from @var{first} @var{step}
Create a newly--allocated stream that contains @var{first} as its first
element and increments each succeeding element by @var{step}, which
defaults to @samp{1}.  @var{first} and @var{step} may be of any numeric
type.

@func{stream-from} is frequently useful as a generator in
@func{stream-of} expressions.  See also @func{stream-range} for a
similar procedure that creates finite streams.

@func{stream-from} could be implemented as:

@example
(stream-iterate
    (lambda (x)
      (+ x step))
  first)
@end example

Example:

@example
(define nats (stream-from 0))
@result{} 0 1 2 ...

(define odds (stream-from 1 2))
@result{} 1 3 5 ...
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-range @var{first} @var{past}
@defunx stream-range @var{first} @var{past} @var{step}
Create a newly--allocated stream that contains @var{first} as its first
element and increments each succeeding element by @var{step}.  The
stream is finite and ends before @var{past}, which is not an element of
the stream.  If @var{step} is not given it defaults to @samp{1} if
@var{first} is less than @var{past} and @samp{-1} otherwise.

@var{first}, @var{past} and @var{step} may be of any numeric type.

@func{stream-range} is frequently useful as a generator in
@func{stream-of} expressions.  See also @func{stream-from} for a similar
procedure that creates infinite streams.

Examples:

@example
(stream-range 0 10)
@result{} 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

(stream-range 0 10 2)
@result{} 0 2 4 6 8
@end example

Successive elements of the stream are calculated by adding @var{step} to
@var{first}, so if any of @var{first}, @var{past} or @var{step} are
inexact, the length of the output stream may differ from:

@example
(ceiling (- (/ (- past first) step) 1)
@end example
@end defun

@c page

@section Comprehensions


@deffn Syntax stream-of @var{expr} @var{clause} ...
Provide the syntax of stream comprehensions, which generate streams by
means of looping expressions.  The result is a stream of objects of the
type returned by @var{expr}.  There are four types of @var{clause}
arguments:

@table @code
@item (var in stream-expr)
Loop over the elements of @var{stream-expr}, in order from the start of
the stream, binding each element of the stream in turn to @var{var}.
@func{stream-from} and @func{stream-range} are frequently useful as
generators for @var{stream-expr}.

@item (var is expr)
Bind @var{var} to the value obtained by evaluating @var{expr}.

@item (pred expr)
Include in the output stream only those elements @var{x} for which
@code{(pred x)} is true.
@end table

The scope of variables bound in the stream comprehension is the clauses
to the right of the binding clause (but not the binding clause itself)
plus the result expression.

When two or more generators are present, the loops are processed as if
they are nested from left to right; that is, the rightmost generator
varies fastest.  A consequence of this is that only the first generator
may be infinite and all subsequent generators must be finite.  If no
generators are present, the result of a stream comprehension is a stream
containing the result expression; thus, @code{(stream-of 1)} produces a
finite stream containing only the element @code{1}.

@example
(stream-of (* x x)
  (x in (stream-range 0 10))
  (even? x))
@result{} 0 4 16 36 64

(stream-of (list a b)
  (a in (stream-range 1 4))
  (b in (stream-range 1 3)))
@result{} (1 1) (1 2) (2 1) (2 2) (3 1) (3 2)

(stream-of (list i j)
  (i in (stream-range 1 5))
  (j in (stream-range (+ i 1) 5)))
@result{} (1 2) (1 3) (1 4) (2 3) (2 4) (3 4)

@section Folding


@defun stream-iterate @var{proc} @var{base}
Create a newly--allocated stream containing @var{base} in its first
element and apply @var{proc} to each element in turn to determine the
succeeding element.  See also @func{stream-unfold} and
@func{stream-unfolds}.

Examples:

@example
(stream-iterate (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) 0)
  => 0 1 2 3 4 ...

(stream-iterate (lambda (x) (* x 2)) 1)
  => 1 2 4 8 16 ...
@end example

Given a seed between 0 and 232, exclusive, the following expression
creates a stream of pseudo--random integers between 0 and 232,
exclusive, beginning with seed, using the method described by Stephen
Park and Keith Miller:

@example
(stream-iterate
  (lambda (x) (modulo (* x 16807) 2147483647))
  seed)
@end example

Example: successive of the following stream approach the value of the
``golden ratio'' 1.618...:

@example
(stream-iterate (lambda (x) (+ 1 (/ x))) 1)
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-fold @var{proc} @var{base} @var{stream}
Apply a binary procedure to @var{base} and the first element of
@var{stream} to compute a new base, then apply the procedure to the new
base and the next element of @var{stream} to compute a succeeding base,
and so on, accumulating a value that is finally returned as the value of
@func{stream-fold} when the end of the @var{stream} is reached.

@var{stream} must be finite, or @func{stream-fold} will enter an
infinite loop.  See also @func{stream-scan}, which is similar to
@func{stream-fold}, but useful for infinite streams.

For readers familiar with other functional languages, this is a
left--fold; there is no corresponding right--fold, since right--fold
relies on finite streams that are fully--evaluated, at which time they
may as well be converted to a list.

@func{stream-fold} is often used to summarize a stream in a single
value, for instance, to compute the maximum element of a stream.

@example
(define (stream-maximum item< strm)
  (stream-fold
    (lambda (x y)
      (if (item< x y) y x))
    (stream-car strm)
    (stream-cdr strm)))
@end example

Sometimes, it is useful to have @func{stream-fold} defined only on
non--null streams:

@example
(define (stream-fold-one proc strm)
  (stream-fold proc
    (stream-car strm)
    (stream-cdr strm)))
@end example

@noindent
@func{stream-minimum} can then be defined as:

@example
(define (stream-minimum item< strm)
  (stream-fold-one
    (lambda (x y)
      (if (item< x y) x y))
    strm))
@end example

@func{stream-fold} can also be used to build a stream:

@example
(define-stream (isort item< strm)
  (define-stream (insert strm x)
    (stream-match strm
      (() (stream x))
      ((y .  ys)
        (if (item< y x)
            (stream-cons y (insert ys x))
          (stream-cons x strm)))))
  (stream-fold insert stream-null strm))
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-scan @var{proc} @var{base} @var{stream}
Accumulate the partial folds of an input @var{stream} into a
newly--allocated output stream.  The output stream is the @var{base}
followed by:

@example
(stream-fold proc base (stream-take i stream))
@end example

@noindent
for each of the first @math{i} elements of @var{stream}.

Examples:

@example
(stream-scan + 0 (stream-from 1))
@result{} (stream 0 1 3 6 10 15 ...)

(stream-scan * 1 (stream-from 1))
@result{} (stream 1 1 2 6 24 120 ...)
@end example
@end defun

@c page
@node streams unfold
@section Unfolding


@defun stream-unfold @var{map} @var{pred} @var{gen} @var{base}
@func{stream-unfold} is the fundamental recursive stream constructor.
It constructs a stream by repeatedly applying @var{gen} to successive
values of @var{base}, in the manner of @func{stream-iterate}, then
applying @var{map} to each of the values so generated, appending each of
the mapped values to the output stream as long as @code{(pred base)} is
non--@false{}.  See also @func{stream-iterate} and
@func{stream-unfolds}.

For example, the expression below creates the finite stream:

@example
0 1 4 9 16 25 36 49 64 81
@end example

@noindent
initially the base is @code{0}, which is less than @code{10}, so
@var{map} squares the base and the mapped value becomes the first
element of the output stream; then @var{gen} increments the base by
@code{1}, so it becomes @code{1}; this is less than @code{10}, so
@var{map} squares the new base and @code{1} becomes the second element
of the output stream; and so on, until the base becomes @code{10}, when
@var{pred?}  stops the recursion and @code{stream-null} ends the output
stream.

@example
(stream-unfold
  (lambda (x) (expt x 2)) ; map
  (lambda (x) (< x 10))   ; pred
  (lambda (x) (+ x 1))    ; gen
  0)                      ; base
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-unfolds @var{proc} @var{seed}
Return @var{n} newly--allocated streams containing those elements
produced by successive calls to the generator @var{proc}, which takes
the current @var{seed} as its argument and returns @code{n+1} values:

@example
(proc seed) -> seed R0 ...  R(n-1)
@end example

@noindent
where the returned @var{seed} is the input @var{seed} to the next call
to the generator and @math{R(i)} indicates how to produce the next
element of the @math{i}-th result stream:

@table @code
@item (value)
@var{value} is the next car of the result stream;

@item #f
no value produced by this iteration of the generator @var{proc} for the
result stream;

@item ()
the end of the result stream.
@end table

It may require multiple calls of @var{proc} to produce the next element
of any particular result stream.  See also @func{stream-iterate} and
@func{stream-unfold}.

@func{stream-unfolds} is especially useful when writing expressions that
return multiple streams.  For instance, with reference to the
definitions below:

@example
(stream-partition pred strm)
@end example

@noindent
is equivalent to:

@example
(values
  (stream-filter pred strm)
  (stream-filter
      (lambda (x)
        (not (pred x)))
     strm))
@end example

@noindent
but only tests @func{pred} once for each element of @var{strm}.

@example
(define (stream-partition pred strm)
  (stream-unfolds
    (lambda (s)
      (if (stream-null? s)
          (values s '() '())
        (let ((a (stream-car s))
              (d (stream-cdr s)))
          (if (pred a)
              (values d (list a) #f)
            (values d #f (list a))))))
    strm))

(call-with-values
  (lambda ()
    (stream-partition odd?
      (stream-range 1 6)))
  (lambda (odds evens)
    (list (stream->list odds)
          (stream->list evens))))
@result{} ((1 3 5) (2 4))
@end example
@end defun

@c page
@node streams map
@section Mapping and side effects


@defun stream-map @var{proc} @var{stream} ...
Apply a procedure element--wise to corresponding elements of the input
streams, returning a newly--allocated stream containing elements that
are the results of those procedure applications.  The output stream has
as many elements as the minimum--length input stream, and may be
infinite.

Example:

@example
(define (square x)
  (* x x))

(stream-map square (stream 9 3))
@result{} 81 9

(define (sigma f m n)
  (stream-fold + 0
    (stream-map f (stream-range m (+ n 1)))))

(sigma square 1 100)
@result{} 338350
@end example
@end defun


@defun stream-for-each @var{proc} @var{stream} ...
Apply a procedure element--wise to corresponding elements of the input
streams for its side--effects; return nothing.  @func{stream-for-each}
stops as soon as any of its input streams is exhausted.

Example, the following procedure displays the contents of a file:

@example
(define (display-file filename)
  (stream-for-each display
    (file->stream filename)))
@end example
@end defun

@c page
@node streams match
@section Matching


@deffn Syntax stream-match @var{stream} @var{clause} ...
Provide the syntax of pattern--matching for streams.  The input
@var{stream} is an expression that evaluates to a stream.  @var{clause}
arguments are of the form:

@example
(@cmeta{pattern} @cmeta{expr})
(@cmeta{pattern} @cmeta{fender} @cmeta{expr})
@end example

@noindent
consisting of a @meta{pattern} that matches a stream of a particular
shape, an optional @meta{fender} that must succeed if the @meta{pattern}
is to match, and an @meta{expr} that is evaluated if the @meta{pattern}
matches.  There are four types of patterns:

@table @code
@item ()
Matches the null stream.

@item (pat0 pat1 ...)
Matches a finite stream with length exactly equal to the number of
pattern elements.

@item (pat0 pat1 ...  . patrest)
Matches an infinite stream, or a finite stream with length at least as
great as the number of pattern elements before the literal dot.

@item pat
Matches an entire stream; should always appear last in the list of
clauses; it's not an error to appear elsewhere, but subsequent clauses
could never match.
@end table

Each @meta{pattern} element may be either:

@table @emph
@item An identifier
Matches any stream element; additionally, the value of the stream
element is bound to the variable named by the identifier, which is in
scope in the fender and expression of the corresponding clause; each
identifier in a single pattern must be unique.

@item A literal underscore
Matches any stream element, but creates no bindings.
@end table

The patterns are tested in order, left--to--right, until a matching
pattern is found; if @meta{fender} is present, it must evaluate as true
for the match to be successful.  Pattern variables are bound in the
corresponding fender and expression.  Once the matching pattern is
found, the corresponding expression is evaluated and returned as the
result of the match.  An error is signaled if no pattern matches the
input stream.

@func{stream-match} is often used to distinguish null streams from
non--null streams, binding head and tail:

@example
(define (len strm)
  (stream-match strm
    (()                 0)
    ((head . tail)      (+ 1 (len tail)))))
@end example

Fenders can test the common case where two stream elements must be
identical; the else pattern is an identifier bound to the entire stream,
not a keyword as in @func{cond}.

@example
(stream-match strm
  ((x y . _) (equal? x y)
   'ok)
  (else
   'error))
@end example

A more complex example uses two nested matchers to match two different
stream arguments; @code{(stream-merge lt? .  strms)} stably merges two
or more streams ordered by the @var{lt?} predicate:

@example
(define-stream (stream-merge lt? . strms)

  (define-stream (merge xx yy)
    (stream-match xx
      (() yy)
      ((x . xs)
       (stream-match yy
         (() xx)
         ((y . ys)
          (if (lt? y x)
              (stream-cons y (merge xx ys))
            (stream-cons x (merge xs yy))))))))

  (stream-let loop ((strms strms))
    (cond ((null? strms)
           stream-null)
          ((null? (cdr strms))
           (car strms))
          (else
           (merge (car strms)
                  (apply stream-merge lt?
                  (cdr strms)))))))
@end example

@section Utilities


@cindex @srfi{} streams utilities


Streams, being the signature structured data type of functional
programming languages, find useful expression in conjunction with
higher--order functions.  Some of these higher--order functions, and
their relationship to streams, are described below.

The identity and constant procedures are frequently useful as the
recursive base for maps and folds; @code{(identity obj)} always returns
@var{obj}, and @code{(const obj)} creates a procedure that takes any
number of arguments and always returns the same @var{obj}, no matter its
arguments:

@example
(define (identity obj)
  obj)

(define (const obj)
  (lambda x obj))
@end example

Many of the stream procedures take a unary predicate that accepts an
element of a stream and returns a boolean.  Procedure @code{(negate
pred)} takes a unary predicate and returns a new unary predicate that,
when called, returns the opposite boolean value as the original
predicate.

@example
(define (negate pred)
  (lambda (x) (not (pred x))))
@end example

@func{negate} is useful for procedures like @func{stream-take-while}
that take a predicate, allowing them to be used in the opposite
direction from which they were written; for instance, with the predicate
reversed, @func{stream-take-while} becomes @func{stream-take-until}.
@func{stream-remove} is the opposite of @func{stream-filter}:

@example
(define-stream (stream-remove pred strm)
  (stream-filter (negate pred) strm))
@end example

A section is a procedure which has been partially applied to some of its
arguments; for instance, @code{(double x)}, which returns twice its
argument, is a partial application of the multiply operator to the
number 2.  Sections come in two kinds:

@itemize
@item
Left sections partially apply arguments starting from the left.

@item
Right sections partially apply arguments starting from the right.
@end itemize

The procedure @func{lsec} takes a procedure and some prefix of its
arguments and returns a new procedure in which those arguments are
partially applied; the procedure @func{rsec} takes a procedure and some
reversed suffix of its arguments and returns a new procedure in which
those arguments are partially applied:

@example
(define (lsec proc . args)
  (lambda x
    (apply proc (append args x))))

(define (rsec proc . args)
  (lambda x
    (apply proc (reverse (append (reverse args)
                                 (reverse x))))))
@end example

Since most of the stream procedures take a stream as their last
(rightmost) argument, left sections are particularly useful in
conjunction with streams.

@example
(define stream-sum (lsec stream-fold + 0))
@end example

Function composition creates a new function by partially applying
multiple functions, one after the other.  In the simplest case there are
only two functions, @var{f} and @var{g}, composed as @code{(compose f
g)}; the composition can be bound to create a new function, as in:

@example
(define fg (compose f g))
@end example

@noindent
the procedure @func{compose} takes one or more procedures and returns a
new procedure that performs the same action as the individual procedures
would if called in succession:

@example
(define (compose . fns)
  (let comp ((fns fns))
    (cond
      ((null? fns) 'error)
      ((null? (cdr fns)) (car fns))
      (else
        (lambda args
          (call-with-values
            (lambda ()
              (apply
                (comp (cdr fns))
                args))
            (car fns)))))))
@end example

@func{compose} works with sections to create succinct but highly
expressive procedure definitions.  The expression to compute the squares
of the integers from 1 to 10 given above at @func{stream-unfold} could
be written by composing @func{stream-map}, @func{stream-take-while}, and
@func{stream-iterate}:

@example
((compose
  (lsec stream-map (rsec expt 2))
  (lsec stream-take-while (negate (rsec > 10)))
  (lsec stream-iterate (rsec + 1)))
 1)
@end example

The examples below show a few of the myriad ways streams can be
exploited, as well as a few ways they can trip the unwary user.  All the
examples are drawn from published sources; it is instructive to compare
the Scheme versions to the originals in other languages.

@subsection Infinite streams


As a simple illustration of infinite streams, consider this definition
of the natural numbers:

@example
(define nats
  (stream-cons 0
    (stream-map add1 nats)))
@end example

@noindent
the recursion works because it is offset by one from the initial
@func{stream-cons}.  Another sequence that uses the offset trick is this
definition of the Fibonacci numbers:

@example
(define fibs
  (stream-cons 1
    (stream-cons 1
      (stream-map +
        fibs
        (stream-cdr fibs)))))
@end example

Yet another sequence that uses the same offset trick is the Hamming
numbers, named for the mathematician and computer scientist Richard
Hamming, defined as all numbers that have no prime factors greater than
5; in other words, Hamming numbers are all numbers expressible as

@example
2i x 3j x 5k
@end example

@noindent
where @var{i}, @var{j} and @var{k} are non--negative integers.  The
Hamming sequence starts with 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 9 10 12 and is computed
starting with 1, taking 2, 3 and 5 times all the previous elements with
@func{stream-map}, then merging @func{sub-streams} and eliminating
duplicates:

@example
(define hamming
  (stream-cons 1
    (stream-unique =
      (stream-merge <
        (stream-map (lsec * 2) hamming)
        (stream-map (lsec * 3) hamming)
        (stream-map (lsec * 5) hamming)))))
@end example

It is possible to have an infinite stream of infinite streams. Consider
the definition of @func{power-table}:

@example
(define power-table
  (stream-of
    (stream-of (expt m n)
      (m in (stream-from 1)))
      (n in (stream-from 2))))
@end example

@noindent
which evaluates to an infinite stream of infinite streams:

@example
(stream
  (stream 1 4 9 16 25 ...)
  (stream 1 8 27 64 125 ...)
  (stream 1 16 81 256 625 ...)
  ...)
@end example

But even though it is impossible to display @func{power-table} in its
entirety, it is possible to select just part of it:

@example
(stream->list 10 (stream-ref power-table 1))
  => (1 8 27 64 125 216 343 512 729 1000)
@end example

This example clearly shows that the elements of a stream are computed
lazily, as they are needed; @code{(stream-ref power-table 0)} is not
computed, even when its successor is displayed, since computing it would
enter an infinite loop.

Chris Reade shows how to calculate the stream of prime numbers according
to the sieve of Eratosthenes, using a method that eliminates multiples
of the sifting base with addition rather than division:

@example
(define primes (let ()
  (define-stream (next base mult strm)
    (let ((first (stream-car strm))
          (rest (stream-cdr strm)))
      (cond ((< first mult)
              (stream-cons first
                (next base mult rest)))
            ((< mult first)
              (next base (+ base mult) strm))
            (else (next base
                    (+ base mult) rest)))))
  (define-stream (sift base strm)
    (next base (+ base base) strm))
  (define-stream (sieve strm)
    (let ((first (stream-car strm))>
          (rest (stream-cdr strm)))
      (stream-cons first
        (sieve (sift first rest)))))
  (sieve (stream-from 2))))
@end example

A final example of infinite streams is a functional pearl from Jeremy
Gibbons, David Lester and Richard Bird that enumerates the positive
rational numbers without duplicates:

@example
(define rats
  (stream-iterate
    (lambda (x)
      (let* ((n (floor x)) (y (- x n)))
        (/ (- n -1 y))))
    1))
@end example

@c page
@node streams examples generators
@subsection Generators and co--routines


It is possible to model generators and co--routines using streams.
Consider the task, due to Carl Hewitt, of determining if two trees have
the same sequence of leaves:

@example
(same-fringe? = '(1 (2 3)) '((1 2) 3))  => #t

(same-fringe? = '(1 2 3) '(1 (3 2)))    => #f
@end example

The simplest solution is to flatten both trees into lists and compare
them element--by--element:

@example
(define (flatten tree)
  (cond [(null? tree) '()]
        [(pair? (car tree))
         (append (flatten (car tree))
                 (flatten (cdr tree)))]
        [else (cons (car tree)
                    (flatten (cdr tree)))]))

(define (same-fringe? eql? tree1 tree2)
  (let loop ([t1 (flatten tree1)]
             [t2 (flatten tree2)])
    (cond [(and (null? t1) (null? t2)) #t]
          [(or (null? t1) (null? t2)) #f]
          [(not (eql? (car t1) (car t2))) #f]
          [else (loop (cdr t1) (cdr t2))])))
@end example

That works, but requires time to flatten both trees and space to store
the flattened versions; if the trees are large, that can be a lot of
time and space, and if the fringes differ, much of that time and space
is wasted.

Hewitt used a generator to flatten the trees one element at a time,
storing only the current elements of the trees and the machines needed
to continue flattening them, so @func{same-fringe?} could stop early if
the trees differ.  Dorai Sitaram presents both the generator solution
and a co--routine solution, which both involve tricky calls to
@func{call-with-current-continuation} and careful coding to keep them
synchronized.

An alternate solution flattens the two trees to streams instead of
lists, which accomplishes the same savings of time and space, and
involves code that looks little different than the list solution
presented above:

@example
(define-stream (flatten tree)
  (cond [(null? tree) stream-null]
        [(pair? (car tree))
         (stream-append
           (flatten (car tree))
           (flatten (cdr tree)))]
        [else (stream-cons
                (car tree)
                (flatten (cdr tree)))]))

(define (same-fringe? eql? tree1 tree2)
  (let loop ([t1 (flatten tree1)]
             [t2 (flatten tree2)])
    (cond [(and (stream-null? t1)
                (stream-null? t2)) #t]
          [(or  (stream-null? t1)
                (stream-null? t2)) #f]
          [(not (eql? (stream-car t1)
                      (stream-car t2))) #f]
          [else (loop (stream-cdr t1)
                      (stream-cdr t2))])))
@end example

Note that streams, a data structure, replace generators or co--routines,
which are control structures, providing a fine example of how lazy
streams enhance modularity.

@node streams examples pipeline
@subsection A pipeline of procedures


Another way in which streams promote modularity is enabling the use of
many small procedures that are easily composed into larger programs, in
the style of Unix pipelines, where streams are important because they
allow a large dataset to be processed one item at a time.  Bird and
Wadler provide the example of a text formatter.  Their example uses
right--folds:

@example
(define (stream-fold-right f base strm)
  (if (stream-null? strm)
      base
    (f (stream-car strm)
       (stream-fold-right f base
         (stream-cdr strm)))))

(define (stream-fold-right-one f strm)
  (stream-match strm
    [(x) x]
    [(x . xs)
     (f x (stream-fold-right-one f xs))]))
@end example

Bird and Wadler define text as a stream of characters, and develop a
standard package for operating on text, which they derive mathematically
(this assumes the line--separator character is a single
@code{#\newline}):

@example
(define (breakon a)
  (stream-lambda (x xss)
    (if (equal? a x)
        (stream-append (stream (stream)) xss)
      (stream-append
        (stream (stream-append
            (stream x) (stream-car xss)))
        (stream-cdr xss)))))

(define-stream (lines strm)
  (stream-fold-right
    (breakon #\newline)
    (stream (stream))
    strm))

(define-stream (words strm)
  (stream-filter stream-pair?
    (stream-fold-right
      (breakon #\space)
      (stream (stream))
      strm)))

(define-stream (paras strm)
  (stream-filter stream-pair?
    (stream-fold-right
      (breakon stream-null)
      (stream (stream))
      strm)))

(define (insert a)
  (stream-lambda (xs ys)
    (stream-append xs (stream a) ys)))

(define unlines
  (lsec stream-fold-right-one
    (insert #\newline)))

(define unwords
  (lsec stream-fold-right-one
    (insert #\space)))

(define unparas
  (lsec stream-fold-right-one
    (insert stream-null)))
@end example

These versatile procedures can be composed to count words, lines and
paragraphs; the @func{normalize} procedure squeezes out multiple spaces
and blank lines:

@example
(define countlines
  (compose stream-length lines))

(define countwords
  (compose stream-length
           stream-concat
           (lsec stream-map words)
           lines))

(define countparas
  (compose stream-length paras lines))

(define parse
  (compose (lsec stream-map
             (lsec stream-map words))
           paras
           lines))

(define unparse
  (compose unlines
           unparas
           (lsec stream-map
             (lsec stream-map unwords))))

(define normalize (compose unparse parse))
@end example

More useful than normalization is text--filling, which packs as many
words onto each line as will fit.

@example
(define (greedy m ws)
  (- (stream-length
       (stream-take-while (rsec <= m)
         (stream-scan
           (lambda (n word)
             (+ n (stream-length word) 1))
           -1
           ws))) 1))

(define-stream (fill m ws)
  (if (stream-null? ws)
      stream-null
    (let* ([n (greedy m ws)]
           [fstline (stream-take n ws)]
           [rstwrds (stream-drop n ws)])
      (stream-append
        (stream fstline)
        (fill m rstwrds)))))

(define linewords
  (compose stream-concat
           (lsec stream-map words)))

(define textparas
  (compose (lsec stream-map linewords)
           paras
           lines))

(define (filltext m strm)
  (unparse (stream-map (lsec fill m) (textparas strm))))
@end example

To display filename in lines of @var{n} characters, say:

@example
(stream-for-each display
  (filltext n (file->stream filename)))
@end example

Though each operator performs only a single task, they can be composed
powerfully and expressively.  The alternative is to build a single
monolithic procedure for each task, which would be harder and involve
repetitive code.  Streams ensure procedures are called as needed.

@node streams examples persistent
@subsection Persistent data


Queues are one of the fundamental data structures of computer science.
In functional languages, queues are commonly implemented using two
lists, with the front half of the queue in one list, where the head of
the queue can be accessed easily, and the rear half of the queue in
reverse order in another list, where new items can easily be added to
the end of a queue.  The standard form of such a queue holds that the
front list can only be null if the rear list is also null:

@example
(define queue-null (cons '() '())

(define (queue-null? obj)
  (and (pair? obj) (null? (car obj))))

(define (queue-check f r)
  (if (null? f)
      (cons (reverse r) '())
    (cons f r)))

(define (queue-snoc q x)
  (queue-check (car q) (cons x (cdr q))))

(define (queue-head q)
  (if (null? (car q))
      (error "empty queue: head")
    (car (car q))))

(define (queue-tail q)
  (if (null? (car q))
      (error "empty-head: tail")
    (queue-check (cdr (car q)) (cdr q))))
@end example

This queue operates in amortized constant time per operation, with two
conses per element, one when it is added to the rear list, and another
when the rear list is reversed to become the front list.
@func{queue-snoc} and @func{queue-head} operate in constant time;
@func{queue-tail} operates in worst--case linear time when the front
list is empty.

Chris Okasaki points out that, if the queue is used persistently, its
time--complexity rises from linear to quadratic since each persistent
copy of the queue requires its own linear--time access.  The problem can
be fixed by implementing the front and rear parts of the queue as
streams, rather than lists, and rotating one element from rear to front
whenever the rear list is larger than the front list:

@example
(define queue-null
  (cons stream-null stream-null))

(define (queue-null? x)
  (and (pair? x) (stream-null (car x))))

(define (queue-check f r)
  (if (< (stream-length r) (stream-length f))
      (cons f r)
    (cons (stream-append f (stream-reverse r))
          stream-null)))

(define (queue-snoc q x)
  (queue-check (car q) (stream-cons x (cdr q))))

(define (queue-head q)
  (if (stream-null? (car q))
      (error "empty queue: head")
    (stream-car (car q))))

(define (queue-tail q)
  (if (stream-null? (car q))
      (error "empty queue: tail")
    (queue-check (stream-cdr (car q)) (cdr q))))
@end example

Memoization solves the persistence problem; once a queue element has
moved from rear to front, it needs never be moved again in subsequent
traversals of the queue.  Thus, the linear time--complexity to access
all elements in the queue, persistently, is restored.

@node streams examples passes
@subsection Reducing two passes to one


The final example is a lazy dictionary, where definitions and uses may
occur in any order; in particular, uses may precede their corresponding
definitions.  This is a common problem.

Many programming languages allow procedures to be used before they are
defined.  Macro processors must collect definitions and emit uses of
text in order.  An assembler needs to know the address that a linker
will subsequently give to variables.  The usual method is to make two
passes over the data, collecting the definitions on the first pass and
emitting the uses on the second pass.  But Chris Reade shows how streams
allow the dictionary to be built lazily, so that only a single pass is
needed.  Consider a stream of requests:

@example
(define requests
  (stream
    '(get 3)
    '(put 1 "a")    ; use follows definition
    '(put 3 "c")    ; use precedes definition
    '(get 1)
    '(get 2)
    '(put 2 "b")    ; use precedes definition
    '(put 4 "d")))  ; unused definition
@end example

We want a procedure that will display cab, which is the result of
@code{(get 3)}, @code{(get 1)}, and @code{(get 2)}, in order.  We first
separate the request stream into gets and puts:

@example
(define (get? obj) (eq? (car obj) 'get))

(define-stream (gets strm)
  (stream-map cadr (stream-filter get? strm)))

(define-stream (puts strm)
  (stream-map cdr  (stream-remove get? strm)))
@end example

Now, @func{run-dict} inserts each element of the puts stream into a lazy
dictionary, represented as a stream of key/value pairs (an association
stream), then looks up each element of the gets stream with
@func{stream-assoc}:

@example
(define-stream (run-dict requests)
  (let ([dict (build-dict (puts requests))])
    (stream-map (rsec stream-assoc dict)
      (gets requests))))

(define (stream-assoc key dict)
    (cond [(stream-null? dict) #f]
          [(equal? key (car (stream-car dict)))
           (stream-car dict)]
          [else (stream-assoc key
                  (stream-cdr dict))]))
@end example

@var{dict} is created in the @func{let}, but nothing is initially added
to it.  Each time @func{stream-assoc} performs a lookup, enough of
@var{dict} is built to satisfy the lookup, but no more.  We are assuming
that each item is defined once and only once.  All that is left is to
define the procedure that inserts new items into the dictionary, lazily:

@example
(define-stream (build-dict puts)
  (if (stream-null? puts)
      stream-null
    (stream-cons
      (stream-car puts)
      (build-dict (stream-cdr puts)))))

@end example

Now we can run the requests and print the result:

@example
(stream-for-each display
  (stream-map cadr (run-dict requests)))
@end example

The @code{(put 4 "d")} definition is never added to the dictionary
because it is never needed.

@node streams examples pitfalls
@subsection Pitfalls


Programming with streams, or any lazy evaluator, can be tricky, even for
programmers experienced in the genre.  Programming with streams is even
worse in Scheme than in a purely functional language, because, though
the streams are lazy, the surrounding Scheme expressions in which they
are embedded are eager.  The impedance between lazy and eager can
occasionally lead to astonishing results.  Thirty--two years ago,
William Burge warned:

@quotation
Some care must be taken when a stream is produced to make sure that its
elements are not really a list in disguise, in other words, to make sure
that the stream elements are not materialized too soon.
@end quotation

For example, a simple version of @func{stream-map} that returns a stream
built by applying a unary procedure to the elements of an input stream
could be defined like this:

@example
(define-stream (stream-map proc strm) ;wrong!
  (let loop ([strm strm])
    (if (stream-null? strm)
        stream-null
      (stream-cons
        (proc (stream-car strm))
        (loop (stream-cdr strm))))))
@end example

That looks right.  It properly wraps the procedure in
@func{stream-lambda}, and the two legs of the @func{if} both return
streams, so it type--checks.  But it fails because the named @func{let}
binds @var{loop} to a procedure using normal @func{lambda} rather than
@func{stream-lambda}, so even though the first element of the result
stream is lazy, subsequent elements are eager.  @func{stream-map} can be
written using @func{stream-let}:

@example
(define-stream (stream-map proc strm)
  (stream-let loop ([strm strm])
    (if (stream-null? strm)
        stream-null
      (stream-cons
        (proc (stream-car strm))
        (loop (stream-cdr strm))))))
@end example

Here, @func{stream-let} assures that each element of the result stream
is properly delayed, because each is subject to the @func{stream-lambda}
that is implicit in @func{stream-let}, so the result is truly a stream,
not a ``list in disguise''.  Another version of this procedure was given
previously at the description of @func{define-stream}.

Another common problem occurs when a stream--valued procedure requires
the next stream element in its definition.  Consider this definition of
@func{stream-unique}:

@example
(define-stream (stream-unique eql? strm) ;wrong!
  (stream-match strm
    [() strm]
    [(_) strm]
    [(a b . _)
     (if (eql? a b)
         (stream-unique eql?
           (stream-cdr strm))
       (stream-cons a
         (stream-unique eql?
           (stream-cdr strm))))]))
@end example

@noindent
the @code{(a b . _)} pattern requires the value of the next stream
element after the one being considered.  Thus, to compute the nth
element of the stream, one must know the n+1st element, and to compute
the n+1st element, one must know the n+2nd element, and to compute...
The correct version, given above in the description of
@func{stream-drop-while}, only needs the current stream element.

A similar problem occurs when the stream expression uses the previous
element to compute the current element:

@example
(define (nat n)
  (stream-ref
    (stream-let loop ([s (stream 0)])
      (stream-cons (stream-car s)
        (loop (stream (add1 (stream-car s))))))
    n))
@end example

@noindent
this program traverses the stream of natural numbers, building the
stream as it goes.  The definition is correct: @code{(nat 15)} evaluates
to 15; but it needlessly uses unbounded space because each stream
element holds the value of the prior stream element in the binding to
@var{s}.

When traversing a stream, it is easy to write the expression in such a
way that evaluation requires unbounded space, even when that is not
strictly necessary.  During the discussion of @ansrfi{40}, Joe Marshall
created this infamous procedure:

@example
(define (times3 n)
  (stream-ref
    (stream-filter
      (lambda (x)
        (zero? (modulo x n)))
      (stream-from 0))
    3))
@end example

@noindent
@code{(times3 5)} evaluates to 15 and @code{(times3 #e1e9)} evaluates to
three billion, though it takes a while.  In either case, @func{times3}
should operate in bounded space, since each iteration mutates the
promise that holds the next value.  But it is easy to write
@func{times3} so that it does not operate in bounded space, as the
follies of @ansrfi{40} showed.

The common problem is that some element of the stream (often the first
element) is bound outside the expression that is computing the stream,
so it holds the head of the stream, which holds the second element, and
so on.  In addition to testing the programmer, this procedure tests the
stream primitives (it caught several errors during development) and also
tests the underlying Scheme system (it found a bug in one
implementation).

Laziness is no defense against an infinite loop; for instance, the
expression below never returns, because the @func{odd?} predicate never
finds an odd stream element.

@example
(stream-null?
  (stream-filter odd?
    (stream-from 0 2)))
@end example

Ultimately, streams are defined as promises, which are implemented as
thunks (lambda with no arguments).  Since a stream is a procedure,
comparisons such as @func{eq?}, @func{eqv?} and @func{equal?} are not
meaningful when applied to streams.  For instance, the expression

@example
(define s ((stream-lambda () stream-null)))
@end example

@noindent
defines @var{s} as the null stream, and @code{(stream-null? s)} is
@true{}, but @code{(eq?  s stream-null)} is @false{}.

To determine if two streams are equal, it is necessary to evaluate the
elements in their common prefixes, reporting @false{} if two elements
ever differ and @true{} if both streams are exhausted at the same time.

@example
(define (stream-equal? eql? xs ys)
  (cond [(and (stream-null? xs)
              (stream-null? ys)) #t]
        [(or (stream-null? xs)
             (stream-null? ys)) #f]
        [(not (eql? (stream-car xs)
                    (stream-car ys))) #f]
        [else (stream-equal? eql?
                (stream-cdr xs)
                (stream-cdr ys))]))
@end example

It is generally not a good idea to mix lazy streams with eager
side--effects, because the order in which stream elements are evaluated
determines the order in which the side--effects occur.  For a simple
example, consider this side--effecting version of @func{strm123}:

@example
(define strm123-with-side-effects
  (stream-cons (begin (display "one") 1)
    (stream-cons (begin (display "two") 2)
      (stream-cons (begin (display "three") 3)
        stream-null))))
@end example

The stream has elements @code{1 2 3}.  But depending on the order in
which stream elements are accessed, @code{"one"}, @code{"two"} and
@code{"three"} could be printed in any order.

Since the performance of streams can be very poor, normal (eager) lists
should be preferred to streams unless there is some compelling reason to
the contrary.  For instance, computing pythagorean triples with streams:

@example
(stream-ref
  (stream-of (list a b c)
    (n in (stream-from 1))
    (a in (stream-range 1 n))
    (b in (stream-range a n))
    (c is (- n a b))
    (= (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c)))
  50)
@end example

@noindent
is about two orders of magnitude slower than the equivalent expression
using loops:

@example
(do ([n 1 (+ n 1)]) ([> n 228])
  (do ([a 1 (+ a 1)]) ([> a n])
    (do ([b a (+ b 1)]) ([> b n])
      (let ([c (- n a b)])
        (if (= (+ (* a a) (* b b)) (* c c))
            (display (list a b c)))))))
@end example

@c end of file
