1. Introduction
---------------

This is a set of  Scheme libraries that defines an augmented
R6RS  Scheme language.   It attempts  to  make self-defining
R6RS  Scheme  implementations more  R6RS  compliant, in  the
sense of "programs that work".  Additionally, some functions
from the SRFI collection is exported by default.

4. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd scheme
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-scheme

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

The stuff was written by Marco Maggi.

  The  "tests/r6rs"  subdirectory  holds R6RS  compatibility
tests gathered  from the PLT  Scheme repository (Thu  Jan 1,
2009).
