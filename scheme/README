1. Introduction
---------------

This is a set of  Scheme libraries that defines an augmented
R6RS  Scheme language.   It attempts  to  make self-defining
R6RS  Scheme  implementations more  R6RS  compliant, in  the
sense of "programs that work".

  Additionally: some functions  from the SRFI collection are
exported  by  default,  and  a  common API  to  the  foreign
function interfaces is defined.

4. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd scheme
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-scheme

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

The stuff was assembled and written by Marco Maggi.

  The  original  SRFI code  is  the  work  of many  authors,
reference of which you can find the at the top of the source
code files.

  The SRFI implementations are a checkout of the development
version  at Launchpad  (see Resources)  by  Derick Eddington
(https://launchpad.net/~derick-eddington).

  Upon inclusion  into Nausicaa further  modifications where
done to the SRFI code.

  The  "tests/r6rs"  subdirectory  holds R6RS  compatibility
tests gathered  from the PLT  Scheme repository (Thu  Jan 1,
2009).  It  is supposed  that the author  of those  tests is
Matthew Flatt.


B. Bug reports

Bug    reports    are     appreciated,    send    them    to
