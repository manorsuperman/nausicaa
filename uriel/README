1. Introduction

This is a collection of Scheme libraries.

4. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd uriel
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-uriel

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

The  stuff was  mainly written  by Marco  Maggi.   Some code
comes  from  discussions  on  the  Ikarus  mailing  list  or
examples in the R6RS original documents.

  The file "libraries/uriel/ffi/compat.ypsilon.sls" contains
a rewriting of the  "ffi.scm" library in the distribution of
Ypsilon Scheme.  The original  code is by Yoshikatsu Fujita,
and is distributed under a BSD-like license.  See the top of
the  file   for  the  full  copyright   notice  and  copying
conditions.
