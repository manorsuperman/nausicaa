		     Nausicaa's development roadmap
		     ==============================


0.1
---

* Finish the POSIX interface.
* Merge Glibc into POSIX interface.
* Merge Linux into POSIX interface.
* Finish the OSSP/sa interface?
* Ideally 0.1 should include  enough interfaces to heterogeneous foreign
  libraries  to be  a good  base of  reasoning about  what is  needed to
  provide a multi-implementation FFI.  This means writing interfaces to:
  Libcurl,  Libev,  GraphicsMagick,  PostgreSQL.   But it  is  too  much
  without help...


0.2
---

* Import in Nausicas/Scheme some sort of contract library.

* Establish a versioning scheme for libraries.
