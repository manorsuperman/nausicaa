		     Nausicaa's development roadmap
		     ==============================


0.1
---

* Finish the SRFI test suite.
* Finish the POSIX interface.
* Finish the Glibc interface.
* Finish the OSSP/sa interface.
* Finish support for Larceny.
* Ideally 0.1 should include  enough interfaces to heterogeneous foreign
  libraries  to be  a good  base of  reasoning about  what is  needed to
  provide a multi-implementation FFI.  This means writing interfaces to:
  Libcurl,  Libev,  GraphicsMagick,  PostgreSQL.   But it  is  too  much
  without help...


0.2
---

* Optimise the interface to the Ypsilon FFI to cache interface LAMBDAs.
* Add  an optional  FFI layer  that  raises better  errors whenever  the
  argument to a foreign function has the wrong type.  Derive it from the
  original Ypsilon asserts.
* Import in Uriel some sort of contract library.
* Put SOS in a working state.
