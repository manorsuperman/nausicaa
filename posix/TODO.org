* system inspection

  Fix the determination  of size for "off_t".  Is  it really "ullong" on
  32 bits?

* fd libraries

  Fix dlsym on lseek.  The  version retrieved looking for "lseek" should
  return an "off_t".  By artificially setting "off_t" as "unsigned-int",
  everything works on a 32bit  platform.  Why the return value cannot be
  the discovered "off_t"?.
