* system inspection

  Fix the determination  of size for "off_t".  Is  it really "ullong" on
  32 bits?

* stub

  Add select stuff to the stub library.

* glibc

  Add the string functions.

  Node "Name Service Switch" (with example stubs library?).

* fd libraries

  Fix failing tests in the file interface.

  Fix dlsym on lseek.  The  version retrieved looking for "lseek" should
  return an "off_t".  By artificially setting "off_t" as "unsigned-int",
  everything works on a 32bit  platform.  Why the return value cannot be
  the discovered "off_t"?.

  Add the scatter/gather fd interface.

  Add the mmap interface.

  Finish the time interface.

  Node "Users and Groups".

  Node "System Management".

  Node "System Configuration".

  Node "Signal Handling".

* streams

  Test and document the streams-pipe library.

  More tests.

* linux

  Add a library  with an interface to the  "waitid()" function described
  in the waitpid manual page (linux specific).
