1. Introduction
---------------

Nausicaa/POSIX  is  a  distribution  of libraries  for  R6RS
Scheme exposing  the POSIX interface to  the Scheme language
level; some  GNU C  Library extensions and  Linux extensions
are also exposed.

  This  package  is  built  on top  of  the  Nausicaa/Scheme
package, making  use of its  foreign-functions interface; at
present, it  supports only GNULinux systems  and the Ikarus,
Mosh and Ypsilon Scheme implementations.

  Some libraries in this  package depend upon the C language
library "libnausicaa-posix", which is built and installed by
this package itself.

4. Install
----------

Be sure to have  installed the Nausicaa/Scheme libraries and
to  read   the  "README.build"  file  for   details  on  the
installation   infrastructure  requirements.    The  package
builds and  installs the Scheme  libraries and a  C language
shared library.

  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa-top>
   $ cd posix
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

		  **** BEGIN WARNING ****
	Do NOT run the tests with root permissions.
		   **** END WARNING ****

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-posix

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
