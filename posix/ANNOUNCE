		       Nausicaa/POSIX
		       ==============

Nausicaa/POSIX  is  a  distribution  of libraries  for  R6RS
Scheme  implementations; it exposes  the POSIX  interface at
Scheme  language  level.   Some  GNU  C  Library  and  Linux
extensions are also exposed.

  The package  is built upon Nausicaa/Scheme,  making use of
its  foreign-functions interface.   It  supports the  Scheme
implementations  Ikarus, Mosh  and  Ypsilon.  The  packaging
infrastructure currently supports only GNU+Linux systems.

  Some Scheme  libraries depend upon the  C language library
"libnausicaa-posix",  which is built  and installed  by this
package.

  The  latest  release  of  the  Nausicaa/POSIX  package  is
