		       ==============

Nausicaa/POSIX  is  a  distribution  of libraries  for  R6RS
Scheme exposing  the POSIX interface to  the Scheme language
level; some  GNU C  Library extensions and  Linux extensions
are also exposed.

  This package currently supports only GNU+Linux systems.

  The  libraries are  built  on top  of the  Nausicaa/Scheme

package.
