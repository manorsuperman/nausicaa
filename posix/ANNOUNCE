		       Nausicaa/POSIX
		       ==============

Nausicaa/POSIX  is  a  distribution  of libraries  for  R6RS
Scheme exposing  the POSIX interface to  the Scheme language
level; some  GNU C  Library extensions and  Linux extensions
are also exposed.

  This package currently supports only GNU+Linux systems.

  The  libraries are  built  on top  of the  Nausicaa/Scheme
package, making use of its foreign-functions interface; some
libraries    depend   upon    the    C   language    library
"libnausicaa-posix",  which is built  and installed  by this
package.

  The  latest  release  of  the  Nausicaa/POSIX  package  is
available at:

     <http://github.com/marcomaggi/nausicaa/downloads>
