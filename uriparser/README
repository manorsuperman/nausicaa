1. Introduction
---------------

This is a Scheme  library for R6RS implementing an interface
to  Uriparser:  a  C   language  library  for  parsing  URIs
compliant with RFC 3986.

  The last time the author bothered to update this paragraph,
he had tested version 0.7.4 of Uriparser.

4. Install
----------

Be sure  to have installed  the Nausicaa/R6RS, Nausicaa/SRFI
and Nausicaa/Uriel libraries first.

  Basically we should do:

   $ cd uriparser
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-uriparser

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
