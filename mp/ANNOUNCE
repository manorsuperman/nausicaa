			Nausicaa/MP
			===========

Nausicaa/MP  is  a  distribution  of  Scheme  libraries;  it
implements  an   interface  to  the   following  C  language
libraries  for multiple  precision  integers, floating-point
numbers and polynomials:

GMP	GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic library.
MPFR	Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable library.
MPFI	Multiple Precision Floating-Point Interval library.
MPC	Multiple Precision Complex library.
MPFRCX	Multiple Precision Real and Complex Polynomial library.

  Nausicaa/MP is  built upon Nausicaa/Scheme,  making use of
its  foreign-functions interface;  so it  currently supports
only  GNU+Linux systems.   Supported  Scheme implementations
are Ikarus, Mosh and Ypsilon.

  The latest release of the Nausicaa/MP package is available
