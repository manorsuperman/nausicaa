1. Introduction
---------------

Nausicaa/MP  is a  set of  Scheme libraries  implementing an
interface  to the  GMP,  MPFR, MPFI  and  MPC libraries  for
multiple precision integers  and floating-point numbers.  It
is based on the "(uriel ffi)" library.

  GMP stands for  GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic library.
The  last  time  the  maintainer  bothered  to  update  this
paragraph,  it  had tested  this  project  with GMP  version
4.2.4.

  MPFR stands for Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable
library.  The  last time  the maintainer bothered  to update
this paragraph, it had tested this project with MPFR version
2.3.1.

  MPFI stands for Multiple Precision Floating-Point Interval
library.  The  last time  the maintainer bothered  to update
this paragraph, it had tested this project with MPFI version
1.3.4.

  MPC  stands for Multiple  Precision Complex  library.  The
last time the maintainer  bothered to update this paragraph,
it had tested this project with MPC version 0.4.6.

4. Install
----------


4.1 Install precedences
-----------------------

To  install  this  package  we  need to  install  first  the
Nausicaa/SRFI and Nausicaa/Uriel packages.


4.2 Install Nausicaa/MP
-----------------------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd mp
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-mp

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
