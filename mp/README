1. Introduction
---------------

Nausicaa/MP  is a  set of  Scheme libraries  implementing an
interface to  the GMP, MPFR, MPFI, MPC  and MPFRCX libraries
for multiple precision  integers and floating-point numbers.
It  is based  on Nausicaa/Scheme  package;  supported Scheme
implementations are Ikarus, Mosh and Ypsilon.

  GMP stands for  GNU Multiple Precision arithmetic library.
The  last  time  the  maintainer  bothered  to  update  this
paragraph,  it  had tested  this  project  with GMP  version
4.3.1.

  MPFR stands for Multiple Precision Floating-Point Reliable
library.  The  last time  the maintainer bothered  to update
this paragraph, it had tested this project with MPFR version
2.4.1.

  MPFI stands for Multiple Precision Floating-Point Interval
library.  The  last time  the maintainer bothered  to update
this paragraph, it had tested this project with MPFI version
1.4.

  MPC  stands for Multiple  Precision Complex  library.  The
last time the maintainer  bothered to update this paragraph,
it had tested this project with MPC version 0.8.

  MPFRCX  stands  for Multiple  Precision  Real and  Complex
Polynomial library.   The last time  the maintainer bothered
to update  this paragraph, it  had tested this  project with
MPFRCX version 0.2.

4. Install
----------

This  package  requires  a  lot of  libraries.   Follow  the
instructions.   Notice that  it is  possible to  disable the
usage  of foreign  libraries, by  selecting  the appropriate
options for the "configure" script.


4.1 Install precedences
-----------------------

To  install  this  package  we  need to  install  first  the
Nausicaa/Scheme  package;  follow  the instructions  in  its
README files.


4.2 Install GMP
---------------

Unpack the tar achive:

  $ tar --extract --bzip2 --file=gmp-4.3.1.tar.bz2
  $ cd gmp-4.3.1

then it should be the usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


4.3 Install MPFR
----------------

Unpack the tar achive:

  $ tar --extract --bzip2 --file=mpfr-2.4.1.tar.bz2
  $ cd mpfr-2.4.1

then it should be the usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


4.4 Install MPFI
----------------

Unpack the tar achive:

  $ tar --extract --gzip --file=mpfi-1.4.tar.gz
  $ cd mpfi-1.4

then it should be the usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


4.5 Install MPC
---------------

Unpack the tar achive:

  $ tar --extract --gzip --file=mpc-0.7.tar.gz
  $ cd mpc-0.7

then it should be the usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


4.6 Install Nausicaa/MP
-----------------------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd mp
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

it is  possible to disable the  usage of a  library with the
following configuration options:

  --disable-mpfr	disables MPFR
  --disable-mpfi	disables MPFI
  --disable-mpc		disables MPC

it is  not possible  to disable GMP.   MPFR is  required for
both MPFI and MPC.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-mp

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
