1. Overview
-----------

CLOS,  an  acronym  for  Common  Lisp Object  System,  is  a
standard set  of extensions to  the Common Lisp  language to
help people do object--oriented programming in Lisp.

Tiny--CLOS is  a Scheme version  of CLOS written in  1992 by
Gregor  Kiczales  at  Xerox  Park.   It  differs  from  CLOS
syntactically, but the basic approach  to OOP is the same as
in CLOS.

R6RS--CLOS  is a  port  of Tiny--CLOS  to  the latest  (6th)
revision of  the language standard for Scheme.   It uses the
library system  that is  new in R6RS  to structure  the code
based  on  functionality  (bootstrap  of  core  classes  and
generic  functions, actual  implementation  of the  standard
protocols, class layout, slot access ...).

Nausicaa/CLOS is a repackaging of R6RS--CLOS.

3. Install
----------

Basically you should do:

   $ cd tiny-clos
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-tiny-clos

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
