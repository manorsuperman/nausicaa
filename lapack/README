1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a  distribution of libraries for R6RS Scheme
implementations;  it provides  a  binding to  the CLAPACK  C
language library.  It  is built upon Nausicaa/Scheme, making
use of its foreign-functions interface.

  The libraries support Ikarus, Mosh and Ypsilon Scheme; the
package supports GNU+Linux systems.

4.1 Install CLAPACK
-------------------

Download  the source archive  "clapack.tgz" from  the Netlib
site and unpack it.  We should follow the instruction in the
"README.install" file, build a shared library and install it
as  "libclapack.so".  This  is what  the author  does  on an
i686-pc-linux-gnu system:

   $ cd CLAPACK
   $ cp INSTALL/make.inc.LINUX make.inc

   # edit the following files commenting out everything
   #
   #   F2CLIBS/libF77/main.c
   #   F2CLIBS/libF77/iargc_.c
   #   F2CLIBS/libF77/getarg_.c

   # edit the file "SRC/xerbla.c" commenting out the
   # "printf()" call

   $ make f2clib \
       CFLAGS='-fPIC -funroll-all-loops -O3 -march=i686 -mtune=i686'
   $ make blaslib \
       CFLAGS='-fPIC -funroll-all-loops -O3 -march=i686 -mtune=i686'
   $ cd SRC
   $ make \
       CFLAGS='-fPIC -funroll-all-loops -O3 -march=i686 -mtune=i686'
   $ cd ..
   $ ar -x F2CLIBS/libF77.a
   $ ar -x F2CLIBS/libI77.a
   $ ar -x blas_LINUX.a
   $ ar -x lapack_LINUX.a

   $ gcc -fPIC -lm -shared *.o \
       -Wl,-soname,libclapack.so -o libclapack.so
   $ strip --strip-unneeded libclapack.so

install  the  library   "libclapack.so"  under,  let's  say,
"/usr/local/lib"; install  the header files  "clapack.h" and
"SRC/f2c.h" under, let's say, "/usr/local/include":

    $ export DESTDIR=
    $ export prefix=/usr/local
    $ install -m 0755 -d "${DESTDIR}/$prefix/lib"
    $ install -m 0755 -d "${DESTDIR}/$prefix/include"
    $ install -m 0644 libclapack.so \
        "${DESTDIR}/$prefix/lib"
    $ install -m 0644 clapack.h SRC/f2c.h \
      	"${DESTDIR}/$prefix/include"


4.2 Install Nausicaa/LAPACK
---------------------------

Be sure to have installed the Nausicaa/Scheme package first.
Read the "README.build" file for details on the installation
infrastructure.  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd lapack
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-lapack

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
