			  List of things to do
			  ====================


* Why I cannot install only the FASL files?
* Add support for pacman.
* Split into multiple git projects?
* Rewrite   the   Scheme   library   tests  for   Autoconf   using   the

  run them with both Ikarus and Ypsilon.
* Document somewhere that ypsilon requires the --compatible flag.
