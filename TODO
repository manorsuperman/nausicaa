			  List of things to do
			  ====================


* Why I cannot install only the FASL files?
* Add support for pacman?
* Add support for dpkg?
* Rewrite  the Scheme library  tests for  Autoconf using  a configurable
  script  rather than  "scheme-script",  so  that, in  some  way, it  is
  possible to run them with both Ikarus and Ypsilon.
* Document somewhere that ypsilon requires the --compatible flag.
* Review the infrastructure documentation.
