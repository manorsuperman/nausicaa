This package is a  distribution of libraries for R6RS Scheme
implementations;  it  provides  bindings  for  the  GPGME  C
languge library, a library of cryptographic procedures.

  It  is  built  upon  Nausicaa/Scheme, making  use  of  its
foreign-functions  interface,  and upon  Nausicaa/GPG-Error.

Ypsilon.   The packaging  infrastructure  currently supports
only GNU+Linux systems.
