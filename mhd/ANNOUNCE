			Nausicaa/MHD
			============

This package is a  distribution of libraries for R6RS Scheme
implementations;   it   provides   bindings  for   the   GNU
libmicrohttpd C language library,  which is supposed to make
it  easy  to   run  an  HTTP  server  as   part  of  another
application.

  It  is  built  upon  Nausicaa/Scheme, making  use  of  its
foreign-functions   interface.   It   supports   the  Scheme
implementations  Ikarus, Mosh  and  Ypsilon.  The  packaging
infrastructure currently supports only GNU+Linux systems.
