1. Overview
-----------

Irregex  by Alex  Shinn is  a fully  portable  and efficient
R[456]RS  implementation of regular  expressions, supporting
both POSIX syntax  with various (irregular) PCRE extensions,
as  well as  SCSH's  SRE syntax,  with  various aliases  for
commonly used patterns.  DFA matching is used when possible,
otherwise a closure-compiled NFA approach is used.

  The  library makes  no assumptions  about the  encoding of
strings  or range  of characters  and  can thus  be used  in
Unicode-aware  Scheme   implementations.   Matching  may  be
performed over standard  Scheme strings, or over arbitrarily
chunked streams of strings.

  This Nausicaa subdirectory holds version 0.7.1 (downloaded
on  Thu  Nov  6,   2008)  repackaged  to  fit  the  Nausicaa
standards.  It requires the Nausicaa/SRFI.

3. Install
----------

Be  sure  to  have  installed the  Nausicaa/SRFI  and  Uriel
libraries first.

  Basically we should do:

   $ cd irregx
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives and Slackware packages.
