@PACKAGE@:
@PACKAGE@: A fully portable and efficient R[456]RS implementation of
@PACKAGE@: regular expressions, supporting both POSIX syntax with various
@PACKAGE@: (irregular) PCRE extensions, as well as SCSH's SRE syntax. DFA
@PACKAGE@: matching is used when possible, otherwise a closure-compiled
@PACKAGE@: NFA approach is used. The library makes no assumptions about
@PACKAGE@: the encoding of strings or range of characters and can thus be
@PACKAGE@: used in Unicode-aware Scheme implementations.
