%description
A  fully portable and  efficient R[456]RS  implementation of
regular  expressions,  supporting  both  POSIX  syntax  with
various (irregular)  PCRE extensions, as well  as SCSH's SRE
syntax.   @PACKAGE_NAME@ is  a repackaging  of  the original
distribution  to   make  it  fit   the  Nausicaa  standards.
Original code by Alex Shinn (http://synthcode.com/).
