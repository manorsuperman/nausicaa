1. Overview
-----------

This directory holds  a set of files to be  used to wrap the
Ikarus  Scheme  executable  with  the GNU  Readline  wrapper
Rlwrap.  The original version of the files was posted to the
Ikarus  Scheme mailing  list <ikarus-users@googlegroups.com>
by Tizio Caio.

  The package is composed  by the Bourne shell script "ike",
which spawns  "rlwrap", and a set of  completion files.  The
script is  meant to be  installed in the "bin"  directory of
the user's home, while the  completion files are meant to be
installed under  the "share/ikarus" directory  of the user's
home.

  The installation  directories can be  changed by modifying
the variables in the "Makefile.custom" file.

  The "ike" script is  automatically generated by a template
"ike.in"  that  is  preprocessed  by  the  "Makefile".   The
template itself is meant to be customised at will.


2. License
----------

The files in this directory are in the public domain.


3. Install
----------

The following rules are available in the "Makefile":

  all -		build the "ike" script from the
		template "ike.in";

  clean -	remove the "ike" script;

  install -	install the directories, the script and
		the completion files;

  uninstall -	uinstall the script, the completion files
		and the installation directories.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the fils under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper
