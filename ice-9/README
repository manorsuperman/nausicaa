1. Introduction
---------------

This  is a  collection of  Scheme libraries  that originally
were  distributed  along  with  Guile,  the  GNU  Ubiquitous
Interface Language for Extensions.

  The code has been ported to Ikarus Scheme.

4. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd ice-9
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-ice-9

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

modified the code: see the top of the source files.


B. Bug reports
--------------

Since the libraries have  been assimilated into the Nausicaa
distribution,  bug  reports must  be  sent  to the  Nausicaa
maintainer at <marcomaggi@gna.org>.


C. Resources
------------

The original version of the  files is available in the Guile
distribution, which being a GNU project can be found here:
