<h2 class="chapter">2 Queues</h2>

<p class="noindent">The functions in this section are imported by:

<pre class="example">     (import (ice-9 q))
</pre>
   <p>This module implements queues holding arbitrary scheme objects and
designed for efficient first&ndash;in/first&ndash;out operations.

   <p><span class="sc">make-q</span> creates a queue, and objects are entered and removed with
<span class="sc">enq!</span> and <span class="sc">deq!</span>.  <span class="sc">q-push!</span> and <span class="sc">q-pop!</span> can be
used too, treating the front of the queue like a stack.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-q</b><var><a name="index-make_002dq-1"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return a new queue. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q?</b><var> obj<a name="index-q_003f-2"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return <code>#t</code> if <var>obj</var> is a queue, or <code>#f</code> if not.

        <p>Note that queues are not a distinct class of objects but are implemented
with cons cells.  For that reason certain list structures can get
<code>#t</code> from <span class="sc">q?</span>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>enq!</b><var> q obj<a name="index-enq_0021-3"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Add <var>obj</var> to the rear of <var>q</var>, and return <var>q</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>deq!</b><var> q<a name="index-deq_0021-4"></a></var><br>
&mdash; Function: <b>q-pop!</b><var> q<a name="index-q_002dpop_0021-5"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Remove and return the front element from <var>q</var>.  If <var>q</var> is empty,
a <code>q-empty</code> exception is thrown.

        <p><span class="sc">deq!</span> and <span class="sc">q-pop!</span> are the same operation, the two names just
let an application match <span class="sc">enq!</span> with <span class="sc">deq!</span>, or <span class="sc">q-push!</span>
with <span class="sc">q-pop!</span>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q-push!</b><var> q obj<a name="index-q_002dpush_0021-6"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Add <var>obj</var> to the front of <var>q</var>, and return <var>q</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q-length</b><var> q<a name="index-q_002dlength-7"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the number of elements in <var>q</var>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q-empty?</b><var> q<a name="index-q_002dempty_003f-8"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return true if <var>q</var> is empty. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q-empty-check</b><var> q<a name="index-q_002dempty_002dcheck-9"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Throw a <code>q-empty</code> exception if <var>q</var> is empty. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q-front</b><var> q<a name="index-q_002dfront-10"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the first element of <var>q</var> (without removing it).  If <var>q</var>
is empty, a <code>q-empty</code> exception is thrown. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q-rear</b><var> q<a name="index-q_002drear-11"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Return the last element of <var>q</var> (without removing it).  If <var>q</var> is
empty, a <code>q-empty</code> exception is thrown. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>q-remove!</b><var> q obj<a name="index-q_002dremove_0021-12"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Remove all occurences of <var>obj</var> from <var>q</var>, and return <var>q</var>. 
<var>obj</var> is compared to queue elements using <code>eq?</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>The <code>q-empty</code> exceptions described above are thrown just as
<code>(raise 'q-empty)</code>, there's no message etc like an error throw.

   <p>A queue is implemented as a cons cell, the <code>car</code> containing a list
of queued elements, and the <code>cdr</code> being the last cell in that list
(for ease of enqueuing).

<pre class="example">     (<var>list</var> . <var>last-cell</var>)
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">If the queue is empty, <var>list</var> is the empty list and <var>last-cell</var>
is <code>#f</code>.

   <p>An application can directly access the queue list if desired, for
instance to search the elements or to insert at a specific point.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>sync-q!</b><var> q<a name="index-sync_002dq_0021-13"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Recompute the <var>last-cell</var> field in <var>q</var>.

        <p>All the operations above maintain <var>last-cell</var> as described, so
normally there's no need for <span class="sc">sync-q!</span>.  But if an application
modifies the queue <var>list</var> then it must either maintain
<var>last-cell</var> similarly, or call <span class="sc">sync-q!</span> to recompute it.

<h2 class="chapter">3 Streams</h2>

<p>A stream represents a sequence of values, each of which is calculated
only when required.  This allows large or even infinite sequences to be
represented and manipulated with familiar operations like &ldquo;car&rdquo;,
&ldquo;cdr&rdquo;, &ldquo;map&rdquo; or &ldquo;fold&rdquo;.  In such manipulations only as much as
needed is actually held in memory at any one time.  The functions in
this section are available from

<pre class="example">     (import (ice-9 streams))
</pre>
   <p>Streams are implemented using promises, which is how the underlying
calculation of values is made only when needed, and the values then
retained so the calculation is not repeated.

   <p>Here is a simple example producing a stream of all odd numbers,

<pre class="example">     (define odds
       (make-stream (lambda (state)
                      (cons state (+ state 2)))
                      1))
     
     (stream-car odds)
     =&gt; 1
     
     (stream-car (stream-cdr odds))
     =&gt; 3
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><span class="sc">stream-map</span> could be used to derive a stream of odd squares,

<pre class="example">     (define (square n) (* n n))
     (define oddsquares (stream-map square odds))
</pre>
   <p>These are infinite sequences, so it's not possible to convert them to a
list, but they could be printed (infinitely) with for example

<pre class="example">     (stream-for-each
          (lambda (n sq)
            (display (format "~a squared is ~a\n" n sq)))
        odds oddsquares)
     
     ;; Prints:
     ;;
     ;; 1 squared is 1
     ;; 3 squared is 9
     ;; 5 squared is 25
     ;; 7 squared is 49
     ;; ...
</pre>
   <div class="defun">
&mdash; Function: <b>make-stream</b><var> proc initial-state<a name="index-make_002dstream-14"></a></var><br>

<h2 class="chapter">4 Optional arguments</h2>

<p>Scheme procedures can either handle a fixed number of actual arguments,
or a fixed number of actual arguments followed by arbitrarily many
additional arguments.  Writing procedures of variable arity can be
useful, but unfortunately, the syntactic means for handling argument
lists of varying length is a bit inconvenient.  It is possible to give
names to the fixed number of argument, but the remaining (optional)
arguments can be only referenced as a list of values.

   <p>The library described in this section makes using optional arguments
much more convenient.  In addition, this library provides syntax for
handling symbols as keywords in argument lists.

   <p>To load the library:

<h3 class="section">4.1 Locally binding optional arguments</h3>

<p>The syntax <span class="sc">let-optional</span> and <span class="sc">let-optional*</span> are for
destructuring rest argument lists and giving names to the various list
elements.  <span class="sc">let-optional</span> binds all variables simultaneously, while
<span class="sc">let-optional*</span> binds them sequentially, consistent with <span class="sc">let</span>
and <span class="sc">let*</span>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Syntax: <b>let-optional</b><var> rest-arg </var>(<var>binding <small class="dots">...</small></var>)<var> expr <small class="dots">...</small><a name="index-let_002doptional-29"></a></var><br>

<blockquote><p>These two macros give us an optional argument interface that is very
Schemey and introduces no fancy syntax.  They are compatible with the
Scsh macros of the same name, but are slightly extended.

        <p>Each of <var>binding</var> may be of one of the forms <var>var</var> or
<code>(</code><var>var</var> <var>default-value</var><code>)</code>.

        <p><var>rest-arg</var> should be the rest&ndash;argument of the procedures these are
used from.  The items in <var>rest-arg</var> are sequentially bound to the
given variable names are.  When <var>rest-arg</var> runs out, the remaining
vars are bound either to the default values or <code>#f</code> if no default
value was specified.  <var>rest-arg</var> remains bound to whatever may have
been left of <var>rest-arg</var>.

        <p>After binding the variables, the expressions <var>expr</var> <small class="dots">...</small> are
evaluated in order.

<blockquote><p><var>args</var> is evaluated and should give a list of the form
<code>(:symbol1 value1 :symbol2 value2 ...)</code>.

        <p>The <var>binding</var>s are variables and default expressions, with the
variables to be set (by name) from the keyword values.

        <p>The <var>body</var> forms are then evaluated and the last is the result.  An
example will make the syntax clearest,

     <pre class="example">          (define args '(:xyzzy "hello" :foo "world"))
          
          (let-keywords args #t
                ((foo  "default for foo")
                 (bar  (string-append "default" "for" "bar")))
            (display foo)
            (display ", ")
            (display bar))
          
          ;; Prints: world, defaultforbar
     </pre>
        <p>The binding for <code>foo</code> comes from the <code>:foo</code> symbol in
<code>args</code>.  But the binding for <code>bar</code> is the default in the
<span class="sc">let-keywords</span>, since there's no <code>:bar</code> in the args.

        <p><var>allow-other-keys?</var> is evaluated and controls whether unknown
symbols as keywords are allowed in the <var>args</var> list.  When true other
keys are ignored (such as <code>:xyzzy</code> in the example), when <code>#f</code>
an error is thrown for anything unknown.

        <p><span class="sc">let-keywords</span> is like <span class="sc">let</span> in that all bindings are made at
once, the defaults expressions are evaluated (if needed) outside the
scope of the <span class="sc">let-keywords</span>.

        <p><span class="sc">let-keywords*</span> is like <span class="sc">let*</span>, each binding is made
successively, and the default expressions see the bindings previously
made.  This is the style used by <span class="sc">lambda*</span> keywords.  For example,

     <pre class="example">          (define args '(:foo 3))
          
          (let-keywords* args #f
                ((foo  99)
                 (bar  (+ foo 6)))
            (display bar))
          
          ;; Prints: 9
     </pre>
        <p>The expression for each default is only evaluated if it's needed,
i.e. if the keyword doesn't appear in <var>args</var>.  So one way to make a
keyword mandatory is to throw an error of some sort as the default.

     <pre class="example">          (define args '(:start 7 :finish 13))
          
          (let-keywords* args #t
                ((start 0)
                 (stop  (error "missing #:stop argument")))
            ...)
          =&gt; ERROR: missing #:stop argument
     </pre>

<h3 class="section">4.3 Creating advanced argument handling procedures</h3>

<p>When using optional and keyword argument lists, <span class="sc">lambda</span> for
creating a procedure then <span class="sc">let-optional</span> or <span class="sc">let-keywords</span> is
a bit lengthy.  <span class="sc">lambda*</span> combines the features of those macros
into a single convenient syntax.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Syntax: <b>lambda*</b> ([<var>var<small class="dots">...</small></var>]<var> <br> </var>[<var>:optional vardef<small class="dots">...</small></var>]<var> <br> </var>[<var>:key vardef<small class="dots">...</small> </var>[<var>:allow-other-keys</var>]]<var> <br> </var>[<var>:rest var | . var</var>])<var> <br> body<a name="index-lambda_002a-33"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Create a procedure which takes optional and/or keyword arguments
specified with <code>:optional</code> and <code>:key</code>.  For example,

     <pre class="lisp">          (lambda* (a b :optional c d . e) '())
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">is a procedure with fixed arguments <var>a</var> and <var>b</var>, optional
arguments <var>c</var> and <var>d</var>, and rest argument <var>e</var>.  If the
optional arguments are omitted in a call, the variables for them are
bound to <code>#f</code>.

        <p><span class="sc">lambda*</span> can also take keyword arguments.  For example, a
procedure defined like this:

     <pre class="lisp">          (lambda* (:key xyzzy larch) '())
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">can be called with any of the argument lists <code>(:xyzzy 11)</code>,
<code>(:larch 13)</code>, <code>(:larch 42 #:xyzzy 19)</code>, <code>()</code>.  Whichever
arguments are given as keywords are bound to values (and those not given
are <code>#f</code>.

        <p>Optional and keyword arguments can also have default values to take when
not present in a call, by giving a two&ndash;element list of variable name
and expression.  For example in

     <pre class="lisp">          (lambda* (foo :optional (bar 42) :key (baz 73))
               (list foo bar baz))
     </pre>
        <p><var>foo</var> is a fixed argument, <var>bar</var> is an optional argument with
default value 42, and baz is a keyword argument with default value 73. 
Default value expressions are not evaluated unless they are needed, and
until the procedure is called.

        <p>Normally it's an error if a call has keywords other than those specified
by <code>:key</code>, but adding <code>:allow-other-keys</code> to the definition
(after the keyword argument declarations) will ignore unknown keywords.

        <p>If a call has a keyword given twice, the last value is used.  For
example,

     <pre class="example">          ((lambda* (:key (heads 0) (tails 0))
             (display (list heads tails)))
           :heads 37 :tails 42 :heads 99)
          
          ;; Prints: (99 42)
     </pre>
        <p><code>:rest</code> is a synonym for the dotted syntax rest argument.  The
argument lists <code>(a . b)</code> and <code>(a :rest b)</code> are equivalent in
all respects.  This is provided for more similarity to <acronym>DSSSL</acronym>,
<acronym>MIT</acronym> Scheme and Kawa among others, as well as for refugees from
other Lisp dialects.

        <p>When <code>:key</code> is used together with a rest argument, the keyword
parameters in a call all remain in the rest list.  This is the same as
Common Lisp.  For example,

     <pre class="lisp">          ((lambda* (:key (x 0) :allow-other-keys :rest r)
             (display r))
           :x 123 :y 456)
          ;; Prints: (:x 123 :y 456)
     </pre>
        <p><code>:optional</code> and <code>:key</code> establish their bindings successively,
from left to right, as per <span class="sc">let-optional*</span> and
<span class="sc">let-keywords*</span>.  This means default expressions can refer back to
prior parameters, for example

     <pre class="lisp">          (lambda* (start :optional (end (+ 10 start)))
            (do ((i start (1+ i)))
                ((&gt; i end))
              (display i)))
     </pre>
        </blockquote></div>

<h3 class="section">4.4 Defining procedures and macros</h3>

<p>Just like <span class="sc">define</span> has a shorthand notation for defining
procedures, <span class="sc">define*</span> is provided as an abbreviation of the
combination of <span class="sc">define</span> and <span class="sc">lambda*</span>.

   <p><span class="sc">defmacro*</span> exists for defining macros with the improved argument
list handling possibilities.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Syntax: <b>define*</b><var> formals body<a name="index-define_002a-34"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p><span class="sc">define*</span> supports optional arguments with a similar syntax to
<span class="sc">lambda*</span>.  It also supports arbitrary&ndash;depth currying.  Some
examples:

     <pre class="lisp">          (define* (x y :optional a (z 3) :key w . u)
            (display (list y z u)))
     </pre>
        <p class="noindent">defines a procedure <code>x</code> with a fixed argument <var>y</var>, an optional
argument <var>a</var>, another optional argument <var>z</var> with default value
3, a keyword argument <var>w</var>, and a rest argument <var>u</var>.

     <pre class="lisp">          (define* ((foo :optional bar) :optional baz) '())
     </pre>
        <p>This illustrates currying.  A procedure <code>foo</code> is defined, which,
when called with an optional argument <var>bar</var>, returns a procedure
that takes an optional argument <var>baz</var>.

        <p>Of course, <span class="sc">define*</span> also supports <code>:rest</code> and
<code>:allow-other-keys</code> in the same way as <span class="sc">lambda*</span>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Syntax: <b>defmacro*</b><var> name formals body<a name="index-defmacro_002a-35"></a></var><br>

<code>:key</code>, <code>:allow-other-keys</code> and <span class="sc">:rest</span> are allowed with
the usual semantics.  Here is an example of a macro with an optional
argument:

     <pre class="lisp">          (defmacro* transmorgify (a :optional b)

<h2 class="chapter">5 Advanced string formatting</h2>

<p>The <code>format</code> function is a powerful way to print numbers, strings
and other objects together with literal text under the control of a
format string.  This function is available from

<pre class="example">     (use-modules (ice-9 format))
</pre>
   <p>A format string is generally more compact and easier than using just
the standard procedures like <code>display</code>, <code>write</code> and
<code>newline</code>.  Parameters in the output string allow various output
styles, and parameters can be taken from the arguments for runtime
flexibility.

   <p><code>format</code> is similar to the Common Lisp procedure of the same
name, but it's not identical and doesn't have quite all the features
found in Common Lisp.

   <p>C programmers will note the similarity between <code>format</code> and
<code>printf</code>, though escape sequences are marked with <code>~</code>
instead of <code>%</code>, and are more powerful.

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Scheme Procedure: <b>format</b><var> dest fmt </var>[<var>args<small class="dots">...</small></var>]<var><a name="index-format-36"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Write output specified by the <var>fmt</var> string to <var>dest</var>. 
<var>dest</var> can be an output port, <code>#t</code> for
<code>current-output-port</code>, a number for <code>current-error-port</code>, or
<code>#f</code> to return the output as a string.

        <p><var>fmt</var> can contain literal text to be output, and <code>~</code>
escapes.  Each escape has the form

     <pre class="example">          ~ [param [, param...] [:] [@] code
     </pre>
        <p><code>code</code> is a character determining the escape sequence.  The
<code>:</code> and <code>@</code> characters are optional modifiers, one or
both of which change the way various codes operate.  Optional
parameters are accepted by some codes too.  Parameters have the
following forms,

          <dl>
<dt><code>[+/-]number</code><dd>An integer, with optional <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>. 
<br><dt><code>'</code>  (apostrophe)<dd>The following character in the format string, for instance <code>'z</code>
for <code>z</code>. 
<br><dt><code>v</code><dd>The next function argument as the parameter.  <code>v</code> stands for
&ldquo;variable&rdquo;, a parameter can be calculated at runtime and included in
the arguments.  Upper case <code>V</code> can be used too. 
<br><dt><code>#</code><dd>The number of arguments remaining.  (See <code>~*</code> below for some
usages.) 
</dl>

        <p>Parameters are separated by commas (<code>,</code>).  A parameter can be
left empty to keep its default value when supplying later parameters.

        <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     The following escapes are available.  The code letters are not
case-sensitive, upper and lower case are the same.

          <dl>
<dt><code>~a</code><dt><code>~s</code><dd>Object output.  Parameters: <var>minwidth</var>, <var>padinc</var>,
<var>minpad</var>, <var>padchar</var>.

          <p><code>~a</code> outputs an argument like <code>display</code>, <code>~s</code>
outputs an argument like <code>write</code>.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~a" "foo") -| foo
               (format #t "~s" "foo") -| "foo"
          </pre>
          <p><code>~:a</code> and <code>~:s</code> put objects that don't have an external
representation in quotes like a string.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~:a" car) -| "#&lt;primitive-procedure car&gt;"
          </pre>
          <p>If the output is less than <var>minwidth</var> characters (default 0), it's
padded on the right with <var>padchar</var> (default space).  <code>~@a</code>
and <code>~@s</code> put the padding on the left instead.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~5a" 'abc)       =&gt; "abc  "
               (format #f "~5,,,'-@a" 'abc) =&gt; "--abc"
          </pre>
          <p><var>minpad</var> is a minimum for the padding then plus a multiple of
<var>padinc</var>.  Ie. the padding is <var>minpad</var> + <var>N</var> *
<var>padinc</var>, where <var>n</var> is the smallest integer making the total
object plus padding greater than or equal to <var>minwidth</var>.  The
default <var>minpad</var> is 0 and the default <var>padinc</var> is 1 (imposing
no minimum or multiple).

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~5,1,4a" 'abc) =&gt; "abc    "
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>~c</code><dd>Character.  Parameter: <var>charnum</var>.

          <p>Output a character.  The default is to simply output, as per
<code>write-char</code>.  <code>~@c</code> prints in <code>write</code> style. 
<code>~:c</code> prints control characters (ASCII 0 to 31) in <code>^X</code> form.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~c" #\z)        -| z
               (format #t "~@c" #\z)       -| #\z
               (format #t "~:c" #\newline) -| ^J
          </pre>
          <p>If the <var>charnum</var> parameter is given then an argument is not taken
but instead the character is <code>(integer-&gt;char </code><var>charnum</var><code>)</code>.  This
can be used for instance to output characters given by their ASCII code.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~65c")  -| A
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>~d</code><dt><code>~x</code><dt><code>~o</code><dt><code>~b</code><dd>Integer.  Parameters: <var>minwidth</var>, <var>padchar</var>, <var>commachar</var>,
<var>commawidth</var>.

          <p>Output an integer argument as a decimal, hexadecimal, octal or binary
integer (respectively).

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~d" 123) -| 123
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@d</code> etc shows a <code>+</code> sign is shown on positive
numbers.

          <!-- FIXME: "+" is not shown on zero, unlike in Common Lisp.  Should -->
<!-- that be changed in the code, or is it too late and should just be -->
<!-- documented that way? -->
<pre class="example">               (format #t "~@b" 12) -| +1100
          </pre>
          <p>If the output is less than the <var>minwidth</var> parameter (default no
minimum), it's padded on the left with the <var>padchar</var> parameter
(default space).

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~5,'*d" 12)   -| ***12
               (format #t "~5,'0d" 12)   -| 00012
               (format #t "~3d"    1234) -| 1234
          </pre>
          <p><code>~:d</code> adds commas (or the <var>commachar</var> parameter) every
three digits (or the <var>commawidth</var> parameter many).

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~:d" 1234567)         -| 1,234,567
               (format #t "~10,'*,'/,2:d" 12345) -| ***1/23/45
          </pre>
          <p>Hexadecimal <code>~x</code> output is in lower case, but the <code>~(</code>
and <code>~)</code> case conversion directives described below can be used
to get upper case.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~x"       65261) -| feed
               (format #t "~:@(~x~)" 65261) -| FEED
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>~r</code><dd>Integer in words, roman numerals, or a specified radix.  Parameters:
<var>radix</var>, <var>minwidth</var>, <var>padchar</var>, <var>commachar</var>,
<var>commawidth</var>.

          <p>With no parameters output is in words as a cardinal like &ldquo;ten&rdquo;, or
<code>~:r</code> prints an ordinal like &ldquo;tenth&rdquo;.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~r" 9)  -| nine        ;; cardinal
               (format #t "~r" -9) -| minus nine  ;; cardinal
               (format #t "~:r" 9) -| ninth       ;; ordinal
          </pre>
          <p>And also with no parameters, <code>~@r</code> gives roman numerals and
<code>~:@r</code> gives old roman numerals.  In old roman numerals
there's no &ldquo;subtraction&rdquo;, so 9 is <code>VIIII</code> instead of
<code>IX</code>.  In both cases only positive numbers can be output.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~@r" 89)  -| LXXXIX     ;; roman
               (format #t "~:@r" 89) -| LXXXVIIII  ;; old roman
          </pre>
          <p>When a parameter is given it means numeric output in the specified
<var>radix</var>.  The modifiers and parameters following the radix are the
same as described for <code>~d</code> etc above.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~3r" 27)   =&gt; "1000"    ;; base 3
               (format #f "~3,5r" 26) =&gt; "  222"   ;; base 3 width 5
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>~f</code><dd>Fixed-point float.  Parameters: <var>width</var>, <var>decimals</var>,
<var>scale</var>, <var>overflowchar</var>, <var>padchar</var>.

          <p>Output a number or number string in fixed-point format, ie. with a
decimal point.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~f" 5)      -| 5.0
               (format #t "~f" "123")  -| 123.0
               (format #t "~f" "1e-1") -| 0.1
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@f</code> prints a <code>+</code> sign on positive numbers (including
zero).

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~@f" 0) -| +0.0
          </pre>
          <p>If the output is less than <var>width</var> characters it's padded on the
left with <var>padchar</var> (space by default).  If the output equals or
exceeds <var>width</var> then there's no padding.  The default for
<var>width</var> is no padding.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~6f" -1.5)      =&gt; "  -1.5"
               (format #f "~6,,,,'*f" 23)  =&gt; "**23.0"
               (format #f "~6f" 1234567.0) =&gt; "1234567.0"
          </pre>
          <p><var>decimals</var> is how many digits to print after the decimal point,
with the value rounded or padded with zeros as necessary.  (The
default is to output as many decimals as required.)

          <p><var>expdigits</var> is the minimum number of digits shown for the

          <p><var>intdigits</var> (default 1) is the number of digits to show before the
decimal point in the mantissa.  <var>intdigits</var> can be zero, in which
case the integer part is a single <code>0</code>, or it can be negative,
in which case leading zeros are shown after the decimal point.

          <!-- FIXME: When INTDIGITS is 0, Common Lisp format apparently only -->

<var>expchar</var>.

          <p>Output a number or number string in either exponential format the same
as <code>~e</code>, or fixed-point format like <code>~f</code> but aligned
where the mantissa would have been and followed by padding where the
exponent would have been.

<p>Fixed-point is used when the absolute value is 0.1 or more and it
takes no more space than the mantissa in exponential format, ie. 
basically up to <var>mantdigits</var> digits.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~12,4,2g" 999.0)    =&gt; "   999.0    "

          <p>The parameters are interpreted as per <code>~e</code> above.  When
fixed-point is used, the <var>decimals</var> parameter to <code>~f</code> is

<p>Output a number or number string in fixed-point format, ie. with a
decimal point.  <var>decimals</var> is the number of decimal places to
show, default 2.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~$" 5)       -| 5.00

          <p>If the output is less than <var>width</var> characters (default 0), it's
padded on the left with <var>padchar</var> (default space).  <code>~:$</code>
puts the padding after the sign.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~,,8$" -1.5)   =&gt; "   -1.50"

          </pre>
          <p>Note that floating point for dollar amounts is generally not a good
idea, because a cent 0.01 cannot be represented exactly in the
binary floating point Guile uses, which leads to slowly accumulating
rounding errors.  Keeping values as cents (or fractions of a cent) in
integers then printing with the scale option in <code>~f</code> may be a
better approach.

          <!-- For reference, fractions don't work with ~$ (or any of the float -->
<!-- conversions) currently.  If they did work then we could perhaps -->
<!-- suggest keeping dollar amounts as rationals, which would of course -->
<!-- give exact cents.  An integer as cents is probably still a better -->
<!-- recommendation though, since it forces one to think about where -->

<br><dt><code>~i</code><dd>Complex fixed-point float.  Parameters: <var>width</var>, <var>decimals</var>,

          <!-- For reference, in Common Lisp ~i is an indent, but slib fmtdoc.txi -->
<!-- described it as complex number output, so we keep that. -->
<p>Output the argument as a complex number, with both real and imaginary
part shown (even if one or both are zero).

          <p>The parameters and modifiers are the same as for fixed-point
<code>~f</code> described above.  The real and imaginary parts are both
output with the same given parameters and modifiers, except that for
the imaginary part the <code>@</code> modifier is always enabled, so as
to print a <code>+</code> sign between the real and imaginary parts.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~i" 1)  -| 1.0+0.0i

               (format #t "enter name~p" 2) -| enter names
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@p</code> prints `<samp><span class="samp">y</span></samp>' for 1 or `<samp><span class="samp">ies</span></samp>' otherwise.

               (format #t "pupp~@p" 2) -| puppies
          </pre>
          <p><code>~:p</code> re-uses the preceding argument instead of taking a new
one, which can be convenient when printing some sort of count.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~d cat~:p" 9)   -| 9 cats
               (format #t "~d pupp~:@p" 5) -| 5 puppies
          </pre>
          <p><code>~p</code> is designed for English plurals and there's no attempt to
support other languages.  <code>~[</code> conditionals (below) may be able to
help.  When using <code>gettext</code> to translate messages <code>ngettext</code>
is probably best though.

          <br><dt><code>~y</code><dd>Pretty print.  No parameters.

          <br><dt><code>~?</code><dt><code>~k</code><dd>Sub-format.  No parameters.

          <p>Take a format string argument and a second argument which is a list of
arguments for that string, and output the result.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~?" "~d ~d" '(1 2))    -| 1 2
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@?</code> takes arguments for the sub-format directly rather than
in a list.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~@? ~s" "~d ~d" 1 2 "foo") -| 1 2 "foo"
          </pre>
          <p><code>~?</code> and <code>~k</code> are the same, <code>~k</code> is provided for
T-Scheme compatibility.

          <br><dt><code>~*</code><dd>Argument jumping.  Parameter: <var>N</var>.

          <p>Move forward <var>N</var> arguments (default 1) in the argument list. 
<code>~:*</code> moves backwards.  (<var>N</var> cannot be negative.)

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~d ~2*~d" 1 2 3 4) =&gt; "1 4"
               (format #f "~d ~:*~d" 6)       =&gt; "6 6"
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@*</code> moves to argument number <var>N</var>.  The first argument is
number 0 (and that's the default for <var>N</var>).

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~d~d again ~@*~d~d" 1 2) =&gt; "12 again 12"

          </pre>
          <p>A <code>#</code> move to the end followed by a <code>:</code> modifier move
back can be used for an absolute position relative to the end of the
argument list, a reverse of what the <code>@</code> modifier does.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~#*~2:*~a" 'a 'b 'c 'd)   -| c
          </pre>
          <p>At the end of the format string the current argument postion doesn't
matter, any further arguments are ignored.

          <br><dt><code>~t</code><dd>Advance to a column position.  Parameters: <var>colnum</var>, <var>colinc</var>,
<var>padchar</var>.

          <p>Output <var>padchar</var> (space by default) to move to the given
<var>colnum</var> column.  The start of the line is column 0, the default
for <var>colnum</var> is 1.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~tX")  =&gt; " X"
               (format #f "~3tX") =&gt; "   X"
          </pre>
          <p>If the current column is already past <var>colnum</var>, then the move is
to there plus a multiple of <var>colinc</var>, ie. column
<var>colnum</var> + <var>N</var> * <var>colinc</var> for the smallest <var>N</var>
which makes that value greater than or equal to the current column. 
The default <var>colinc</var> is 1 (which means no further move).

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "abcd~2,5,'.tx") =&gt; "abcd...x"
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@t</code> takes <var>colnum</var> as an offset from the current column. 
<var>colnum</var> many pad characters are output, then further padding to
make the current column a multiple of <var>colinc</var>, if it isn't
already so.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "a~3,5'*@tx") =&gt; "a****x"
          </pre>
          <p><code>~t</code> is implemented using <code>port-column</code>, so it works even
there has been other output before <code>format</code>.

          <br><dt><code>~~</code><dd>Tilde character.  Parameter: <var>n</var>.

          <p>Output a tilde character <code>~</code>, or <var>n</var> many if a parameter is
given.  Normally <code>~</code> introduces an escape sequence, <code>~~</code>
is the way to output a literal tilde.

          <br><dt><code>~%</code><dd>Newline.  Parameter: <var>n</var>.

          <p>Output a newline character, or <var>n</var> many if a parameter is given. 
A newline (or a few newlines) can of course be output just by
including them in the format string.

          <br><dt><code>~&amp;</code><dd>Start a new line.  Parameter: <var>n</var>.

          <p>Output a newline if not already at the start of a line.  With a
parameter, output that many newlines, but with the first only if not
already at the start of a line.  So for instance 3 would be a newline
if not already at the start of a line, and 2 further newlines.

          <br><dt><code>~_</code><dd>Space character.  Parameter: <var>n</var>.

          <!-- For reference, in Common Lisp ~_ is a conditional newline, but -->
<!-- slib fmtdoc.txi described it as a space, so we keep that. -->
<p>Output a space character, or <var>n</var> many if a parameter is given.

          <p>With a variable parameter this is one way to insert runtime calculated
padding (<code>~t</code> or the various field widths can do similar
things).

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~v_foo" 4) =&gt; "    foo"
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>~/</code><dd>Tab character.  Parameter: <var>n</var>.

          <p>Output a tab character, or <var>n</var> many if a parameter is given.

          <br><dt><code>~|</code><dd>Formfeed character.  Parameter: <var>n</var>.

          <p>Output a formfeed character, or <var>n</var> many if a parameter is given.

          <br><dt><code>~!</code><dd>Force output.  No parameters.

          <p>At the end of output, call <code>force-output</code> to flush any buffers on
the destination.  <code>~!</code> can occur anywhere in the format string, but
the force is done at the end of output.

          <p>When output is to a string (destination <code>#f</code>), <code>~!</code> does
nothing.

          <br><dt><code>~newline</code>  (ie. newline character)<dd>Continuation line.  No parameters.

          <p>Skip this newline and any following whitespace in the format string,
ie. don't send it to the output.  This can be used to break up a
long format string for readability, but not print the extra
whitespace.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "abc~
                           ~d def~
                           ~d" 1 2) =&gt; "abc1 def2"
          </pre>
          <p><code>~:newline</code> skips the newline but leaves any further whitespace
to be printed normally.

          <p><code>~@newline</code> prints the newline then skips following
whitespace.

          <br><dt><code>~(</code> <code>~)</code><dd>Case conversion.  No parameters.

          <p>Between <code>~(</code> and <code>~)</code> the case of all output is changed. 
The modifiers on <code>~(</code> control the conversion.

               <ul>
<li><code>~(</code> &mdash; lower case. 
<!-- FIXME: The : and @ modifiers are not yet documented because the -->

<!-- including literal characters in the format string, which has the -->
<!-- silly effect of being always an upcase. -->
<!-- The Common Lisp spec is apparently for the capitalization to be -->
<!-- applied in one hit to the whole of the output between ~( and ~). -->
<!-- (This can no doubt be implemented without accumulating all that -->

          <p>For example,

               (format #t "~:@(Hello~)") -| HELLO
          </pre>
          <p>In the future it's intended the modifiers <code>:</code> and <code>@</code>
alone will capitalize the first letters of words, as per Common Lisp
<code>format</code>, but the current implementation of this is flawed and
not recommended for use.

          <p>Case conversions do not nest, currently.  This might change in the
future, but if it does then it will be to Common Lisp style where the
outermost conversion has priority, overriding inner ones (making those
fairly pointless).

          <br><dt><code>~{</code> <code>~}</code><dd>Iteration.  Parameter: <var>maxreps</var> (for <code>~{</code>).

          <p>The format between <code>~{</code> and <code>~}</code> is iterated.  The
modifiers to <code>~{</code> determine how arguments are taken.  The

          <p><code>~:{</code> takes a single argument which is a list of lists, each
of those contained lists gives the arguments for the iterated format.

          <!-- @print{} on a new line here to avoid overflowing page width in DVI -->
<pre class="example">               (format #t "~:{~dx~d ~}" '((1 2) (3 4) (5 6)))
               -| 1x2 3x4 5x6
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@{</code> takes arguments directly, with each iteration
successively consuming arguments.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~@{~d~}"     1 2 3)       -| 123
               (format #t "~@{~s=~d ~}" "x" 1 "y" 2) -| "x"=1 "y"=2
          </pre>
          <p><code>~:@{</code> takes list arguments, one argument for each iteration,
using that list for the format.

          <!-- @print{} on a new line here to avoid overflowing page width in DVI -->
<pre class="example">               (format #t "~:@{~dx~d ~}" '(1 2) '(3 4) '(5 6))
               -| 1x2 3x4 5x6
          </pre>
          <p>Iterating stops when there are no more arguments or when the
<var>maxreps</var> parameter to <code>~{</code> is reached (default no
maximum).

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~2{~d~}" '(1 2 3 4)) -| 12
          </pre>
          <p>If the format between <code>~{</code> and <code>~}</code> is empty, then a
format string argument is taken (before iteration argument(s)) and
used instead.  This allows a sub-format (like <code>~?</code> above) to be
iterated.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~{~}" "~d" '(1 2 3)) -| 123
          </pre>
          <!-- FIXME: What is the @code{:} modifier to ~} meant to do?  The -->
<!-- Common Lisp spec says it's a minimum of 1 iteration, but the -->
<!-- format.scm code seems to merely make it have MAXREPS default to 1. -->
<p>Iterations can be nested, an inner iteration operates in the same way
as described, but of course on the arguments the outer iteration
provides it.  This can be used to work into nested list structures. 
For example in the following the inner <code>~{~d~}x</code> is applied
to <code>(1 2)</code> then <code>(3 4 5)</code> etc.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~{~{~d~}x~}" '((1 2) (3 4 5))) -| 12x345x
          </pre>
          <p>See also <code>~^</code> below for escaping from iteration.

          <br><dt><code>~[</code> <code>~;</code> <code>~]</code><dd>Conditional.  Parameter: <var>selector</var>.

          <p>A conditional block is delimited by <code>~[</code> and <code>~]</code>, and
<code>~;</code> separates clauses within the block.  <code>~[</code> takes an
integer argument and that number clause is used.  The first clause is
number 0.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~[peach~;banana~;mango~]" 1)  =&gt; "banana"
          </pre>
          <p>The <var>selector</var> parameter can be used for the clause number,
instead of taking an argument.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~2[peach~;banana~;mango~]") =&gt; "mango"
          </pre>
          <p>If the clause number is out of range then nothing is output.  Or the
last clause can be <code>~:;</code> to use that for a number out of range.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~[banana~;mango~]"         99) =&gt; ""
               (format #f "~[banana~;mango~:;fruit~]" 99) =&gt; "fruit"
          </pre>
          <p><code>~:[</code> treats the argument as a flag, and expects two clauses. 
The first is used if the argument is <code>#f</code> or the second
otherwise.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~:[false~;not false~]" #f)   =&gt; "false"
               (format #f "~:[false~;not false~]" 'abc) =&gt; "not false"
               
               (let ((n 3))
                 (format #t "~d gnu~:[s are~; is~] here" n (= 1 n)))
               -| 3 gnus are here
          </pre>
          <p><code>~@[</code> also treats the argument as a flag, and expects one
clause.  If the argument is <code>#f</code> then no output is produced and
the argument is consumed, otherwise the clause is used and the
argument is not consumed, it's left for the clause.  This can be used
for instance to suppress output if <code>#f</code> means something not
available.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~@[temperature=~d~]" 27) =&gt; "temperature=27"
               (format #f "~@[temperature=~d~]" #f) =&gt; ""
          </pre>
          <br><dt><code>~^</code><dd>Escape.  Parameters: <var>val1</var>, <var>val2</var>, <var>val3</var>.

          <p>Stop formatting if there are no more arguments.  This can be used for
instance to have a format string adapt to a variable number of
arguments.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~d~^ ~d" 1)   -| 1
               (format #t "~d~^ ~d" 1 2) -| 1 2
          </pre>
          <p>Within a <code>~{</code> <code>~}</code> iteration, <code>~^</code> stops the
current iteration step if there are no more arguments to that step,
but continuing with possible further steps and the rest of the format. 
This can be used for instance to avoid a separator on the last
iteration, or to adapt to variable length argument lists.

          <pre class="example">               (format #f "~{~d~^/~} go"    '(1 2 3))     =&gt; "1/2/3 go"
               (format #f "~:{ ~d~^~d~} go" '((1) (2 3))) =&gt; " 1 23 go"
          </pre>
          <!-- For reference, format.scm doesn't implement that Common Lisp ~:^ -->
<!-- modifier which stops the entire iterating of ~:{ or ~@:{. -->
<!-- FIXME: Believe the Common Lisp spec is for ~^ within ~[ ~] -->
<!-- conditional to terminate the whole format (or iteration step if in -->
<!-- an iteration).  But format.scm seems to terminate just the -->
<!-- conditional form. -->
<!-- (format #f "~[abc~^def~;ghi~] blah" 0) -->
<!-- @result{} "abc blah"                    ;; looks wrong -->
<!-- FIXME: Believe the Common Lisp spec is for ~^ within ~( ~) to end -->
<!-- that case conversion and then also terminate the whole format (or -->
<!-- iteration step if in an iteration).  But format.scm doesn't seem -->
<!-- to do that quite right. -->
<!-- (format #f "~d ~^ ~d" 1)      @result{} "1 " -->
<!-- (format #f "~(~d ~^ ~d~)" 1)  @result{} ERROR -->
<p>Within a <code>~?</code> sub-format, <code>~^</code> operates just on that
sub-format.  If it terminates the sub-format then the originating
format will still continue.

          <pre class="example">               (format #t "~? items" "~d~^ ~d" '(1))   -| 1 items
               (format #t "~? items" "~d~^ ~d" '(1 2)) -| 1 2 items
          </pre>
          <p>The parameters to <code>~^</code> (which are numbers) change the condition
used to terminate.  For a single parameter, termination is when that
value is zero (notice this makes plain <code>~^</code> equivalent to
<code>~#^</code>).  For two parameters, termination is when those two are
equal.  For three parameters, termination is when <var>val1</var>
&lt;= <var>val2</var> and <var>val2</var> &lt;= <var>val3</var>.

          <!-- FIXME: Good examples of these? -->
<br><dt><code>~q</code><dd>Inquiry message.  Insert a copyright message into the output.

          <p><code>~:q</code> inserts the format implementation version. 
</dl>

        <pre class="sp">
     
     </pre>
     It's an error if there are not enough arguments for the escapes in the
format string, but any excess arguments are ignored.

        <p>Iterations <code>~{</code> <code>~}</code> and conditionals <code>~[</code>
<code>~;</code> <code>~]</code> can be nested, but must be properly nested,
meaning the inner form must be entirely within the outer form.  So
it's not possible, for instance, to try to conditionalize the endpoint
of an iteration.

     <pre class="example">          (format #t "~{ ~[ ... ~] ~}" ...)       ;; good
          (format #t "~{ ~[ ... ~} ... ~]" ...)   ;; bad
     </pre>
        <p>The same applies to case conversions <code>~(</code> <code>~)</code>, they
must properly nest with respect to iterations and conditionals (though
currently a case conversion cannot nest within another case
conversion).

        <p>When a sub-format (<code>~?</code>) is used, that sub-format string must
be self-contained.  It cannot for instance give a <code>~{</code> to
begin an iteration form and have the <code>~}</code> up in the
originating format, or similar. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <pre class="sp">

</pre>
Guile contains a <code>format</code> procedure even when the module
<code>(ice-9 format)</code> is not loaded.  The default <code>format</code> is
<code>simple-format</code>, it doesn't support all escape sequences documented
in this section, and will signal an error if you try to use one of them. 
The reason for two versions is that the full <code>format</code> is fairly
large and requires some time to load.  <code>simple-format</code> is often
adequate too.

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place &ndash; Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
     
     [This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
     as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the
     version number 2.1.]
</pre>
<h4 class="appendixsubsec">A.0.1 Preamble</h4>

<p>The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software&mdash;to make sure the software is free for all its users.

   <p>This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software&mdash;typically libraries&mdash;of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You can use
it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this
license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to
use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

   <p>When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these
things.

   <p>To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

   <p>For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

   <p>We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

   <p>To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

   <p>Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

   <p>Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

   <p>When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

   <p>We call this license the <dfn>Lesser</dfn> General Public License because it
does <em>Less</em> to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

   <p>For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

   <p>In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

   <p>Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

   <p>The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
&ldquo;work based on the library&rdquo; and a &ldquo;work that uses the library&rdquo;.  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program
which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this
Lesser General Public License (also called &ldquo;this License&rdquo;).  Each
licensee is addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>A &ldquo;library&rdquo; means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

     <p>The &ldquo;Library&rdquo;, below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A &ldquo;work based on the
Library&rdquo; means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term &ldquo;modification&rdquo;.)

     <p>&ldquo;Source code&rdquo; for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

     <p>Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.

     <li>You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

     <p>You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

     <li>You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>The modified work must itself be a software library.

          <li>You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

          <li>You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

          <li>If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
in the event an application does not supply such function or
table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
its purpose remains meaningful.

          <p>(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
application-supplied function or table used by this function must
be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)
          </ol>

     <p>These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

     <p>Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

     <p>In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

     <li>You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

     <p>Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

     <p>This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

     <li>You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

     <p>If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

     <li>A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo;.  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

     <p>However, linking a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a &ldquo;work that uses the
library&rdquo;.  The executable is therefore covered by this License. 
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

     <p>When a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not. 
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

     <p>If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

     <p>Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. 
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

     <li>As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a &ldquo;work that uses the Library&rdquo; with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

     <p>You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
with the Library, with the complete machine-readable &ldquo;work that
uses the Library&rdquo;, as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
to use the modified definitions.)

          <li>Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.  A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the
library already present on the user's computer system, rather than
copying library functions into the executable, and (2) will operate
properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs
one, as long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the
version that the work was made with.

          <li>Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
least three years, to give the same user the materials
specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
than the cost of performing this distribution.

          <li>If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
specified materials from the same place.

          <li>Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
          </ol>

     <p>For an executable, the required form of the &ldquo;work that uses the
Library&rdquo; must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

     <p>It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

     <li>You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

          <ol type=a start=1>
<li>Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
Sections above.

          <li>Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
          </ol>

     <li>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

     <li>Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. 
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

     <li>If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

     <p>If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

     <p>It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

     <p>This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

     <li>If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

     <li>The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. 
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     <p>Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
&ldquo;any later version&rdquo;, you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

     <li>If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

     <li>BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. 
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

     <li>IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
        </ol>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">A.0.2 How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries</h4>

<p>If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

   <p>To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
&ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

<pre class="smallexample">     <var>one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.</var>
     Copyright (C) <var>year</var>  <var>name of author</var>
     
     This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
     under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by
     the Free Software Foundation; either version 2.1 of the License, or (at
     your option) any later version.
     
     This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
     WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
     Lesser General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
     License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307,
     USA.
</pre>
   <p>Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

   <p>You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a &ldquo;copyright disclaimer&rdquo; for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

<pre class="smallexample">     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the library

<p><a name="index-FDL_002c-GNU-Free-Documentation-License-38"></a><div align="center">Version 1.1, March 2000</div>

<pre class="display">     Copyright &copy; 2000 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307, USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
</pre>
     <ol type=1 start=0>
<li>PREAMBLE

     <p>The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other
written document <dfn>free</dfn> in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone
the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without
modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially.  Secondarily,
this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get
credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for
modifications made by others.

     <p>This License is a kind of &ldquo;copyleft&rdquo;, which means that derivative
works of the document must themselves be free in the same sense.  It
complements the GNU General Public License, which is a copyleft
license designed for free software.

     <p>We have designed this License in order to use it for manuals for free
software, because free software needs free documentation: a free
program should come with manuals providing the same freedoms that the
software does.  But this License is not limited to software manuals;
it can be used for any textual work, regardless of subject matter or
whether it is published as a printed book.  We recommend this License
principally for works whose purpose is instruction or reference.

     <li>APPLICABILITY AND DEFINITIONS

     <p>This License applies to any manual or other work that contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it can be distributed
under the terms of this License.  The &ldquo;Document&rdquo;, below, refers to any
such manual or work.  Any member of the public is a licensee, and is
addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;.

     <p>A &ldquo;Modified Version&rdquo; of the Document means any work containing the
Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with
modifications and/or translated into another language.

     <p>A &ldquo;Secondary Section&rdquo; is a named appendix or a front-matter section of
the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the
publishers or authors of the Document to the Document's overall subject
(or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly
within that overall subject.  (For example, if the Document is in part a
textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any
mathematics.)  The relationship could be a matter of historical
connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal,
commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding
them.

     <p>The &ldquo;Invariant Sections&rdquo; are certain Secondary Sections whose titles
are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice
that says that the Document is released under this License.

     <p>The &ldquo;Cover Texts&rdquo; are certain short passages of text that are listed,
as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that
the Document is released under this License.

     <p>A &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy,
represented in a format whose specification is available to the
general public, whose contents can be viewed and edited directly and
straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of
pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available
drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or
for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input
to text formatters.  A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file
format whose markup has been designed to thwart or discourage
subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent.  A copy that is
not &ldquo;Transparent&rdquo; is called &ldquo;Opaque&rdquo;.

     <p>Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain
<span class="sc">ascii</span> without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format,
<acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> using a publicly available
<acronym>DTD</acronym>, and standard-conforming simple <acronym>HTML</acronym> designed
for human modification.  Opaque formats include PostScript,
<acronym>PDF</acronym>, proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by
proprietary word processors, <acronym>SGML</acronym> or <acronym>XML</acronym> for which
the <acronym>DTD</acronym> and/or processing tools are not generally available,
and the machine-generated <acronym>HTML</acronym> produced by some word
processors for output purposes only.

     <p>The &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means, for a printed book, the title page itself,
plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material
this License requires to appear in the title page.  For works in
formats which do not have any title page as such, &ldquo;Title Page&rdquo; means
the text near the most prominent appearance of the work's title,
preceding the beginning of the body of the text.

     <li>VERBATIM COPYING

     <p>You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either
commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the
copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies
to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other
conditions whatsoever to those of this License.  You may not use
technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further
copying of the copies you make or distribute.  However, you may accept
compensation in exchange for copies.  If you distribute a large enough
number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3.

     <p>You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and
you may publicly display copies.

     <li>COPYING IN QUANTITY

     <p>If you publish printed copies of the Document numbering more than 100,
and the Document's license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose
the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover
Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on
the back cover.  Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify
you as the publisher of these copies.  The front cover must present
the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and
visible.  You may add other material on the covers in addition. 
Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve
the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated
as verbatim copying in other respects.

     <p>If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit
legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit
reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent
pages.

     <p>If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering
more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent
copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy
a publicly-accessible computer-network location containing a complete
Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material, which the
general network-using public has access to download anonymously at no
charge using public-standard network protocols.  If you use the latter
option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin
distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this
Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location
until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque
copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to
the public.

     <p>It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the
Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give
them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document.

     <li>MODIFICATIONS

     <p>You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under
the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release
the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified
Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution
and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy
of it.  In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version:

          <ol type=A start=1>
<li>Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct
from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions
(which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section
of the Document).  You may use the same title as a previous version
if the original publisher of that version gives permission.

          <li>List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities
responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified
Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the
Document (all of its principal authors, if it has less than five).

          <li>State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the
Modified Version, as the publisher.

          <li>Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document.

          <li>Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications
adjacent to the other copyright notices.

          <li>Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice
giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the
terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below.

          <li>Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections
and required Cover Texts given in the Document's license notice.

          <li>Include an unaltered copy of this License.

          <li>Preserve the section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;, and its title, and add to
it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and
publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page.  If
there is no section entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo; in the Document, create one
stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as
given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified
Version as stated in the previous sentence.

          <li>Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for
public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise
the network locations given in the Document for previous versions
it was based on.  These may be placed in the &ldquo;History&rdquo; section. 
You may omit a network location for a work that was published at
least four years before the Document itself, or if the original
publisher of the version it refers to gives permission.

          <li>In any section entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgments&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;,
preserve the section's title, and preserve in the section all the
substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgments
and/or dedications given therein.

          <li>Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document,
unaltered in their text and in their titles.  Section numbers
or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles.

          <li>Delete any section entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;.  Such a section
may not be included in the Modified Version.

          <li>Do not retitle any existing section as &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;
or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section.
          </ol>

     <p>If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or
appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material
copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all
of these sections as invariant.  To do this, add their titles to the
list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version's license notice. 
These titles must be distinct from any other section titles.

     <p>You may add a section entitled &ldquo;Endorsements&rdquo;, provided it contains
nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various
parties&mdash;for example, statements of peer review or that the text has
been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a
standard.

     <p>You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a
passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list
of Cover Texts in the Modified Version.  Only one passage of
Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or
through arrangements made by) any one entity.  If the Document already
includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or
by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of,
you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit
permission from the previous publisher that added the old one.

     <p>The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License
give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or
imply endorsement of any Modified Version.

     <li>COMBINING DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may combine the Document with other documents released under this
License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified
versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the
Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and
list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its
license notice.

     <p>The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and
multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single
copy.  If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but
different contents, make the title of each such section unique by
adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original
author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. 
Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of
Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work.

     <p>In the combination, you must combine any sections entitled &ldquo;History&rdquo;
in the various original documents, forming one section entitled
&ldquo;History&rdquo;; likewise combine any sections entitled &ldquo;Acknowledgments&rdquo;,
and any sections entitled &ldquo;Dedications&rdquo;.  You must delete all sections
entitled &ldquo;Endorsements.&rdquo;

     <li>COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS

     <p>You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents
released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this
License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in
the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for
verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects.

     <p>You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute
it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this
License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all
other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document.

     <li>AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS

     <p>A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate
and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version
of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the
compilation.  Such a compilation is called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo;, and this
License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled
with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they
are not themselves derivative works of the Document.

     <p>If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these
copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one quarter
of the entire aggregate, the Document's Cover Texts may be placed on
covers that surround only the Document within the aggregate. 
Otherwise they must appear on covers around the whole aggregate.

     <li>TRANSLATION

     <p>Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may
distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. 
Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special
permission from their copyright holders, but you may include
translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the
original versions of these Invariant Sections.  You may include a
translation of this License provided that you also include the
original English version of this License.  In case of a disagreement
between the translation and the original English version of this
License, the original English version will prevail.

     <li>TERMINATION

     <p>You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except
as expressly provided for under this License.  Any other attempt to
copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Document is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License.  However,
parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.

     <li>FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE

     <p>The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions
of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time.  Such new
versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.  See
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/">http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/</a>.

     <p>Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. 
If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this
License &ldquo;or any later version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or
of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the
Free Software Foundation.  If the Document does not specify a version
number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not
as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation.
        </ol>

<h4 class="appendixsubsec">B.0.1 ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents</h4>

<p>To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of
the License in the document and put the following copyright and
license notices just after the title page:

<pre class="smallexample">       Copyright (C)  <var>year</var>  <var>your name</var>.
       Permission is granted to copy, distribute and/or modify this document
       under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License, Version 1.1
       or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation;
       with the Invariant Sections being <var>list their titles</var>, with the
       Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>, and with the Back-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>.
       A copy of the license is included in the section entitled ``GNU
       Free Documentation License''.
</pre>
   <p>If you have no Invariant Sections, write &ldquo;with no Invariant Sections&rdquo;
instead of saying which ones are invariant.  If you have no
Front-Cover Texts, write &ldquo;no Front-Cover Texts&rdquo; instead of
&ldquo;Front-Cover Texts being <var>list</var>&rdquo;; likewise for Back-Cover Texts.

   <p>If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we
recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of
free software license, such as the GNU General Public License,
to permit their use in free software.
