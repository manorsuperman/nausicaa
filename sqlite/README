1. Introduction
---------------

Nausicaa/SQLite  is a  distribution of  librarires  for R6RS
Scheme  implementations;  it  implements  a binding  to  the
SQLite   SQL   database    engine.    It   is   built   upon
Nausicaa/Scheme,  making   use  of  its   foreign  functions
interface; so it  currently supports only GNU+Linux systems.
It suports Ikarus, Mosh and Ypsilon Scheme.

  Unfortunately,  SQLite makes use  of callbacks,  which are
not  supported by  Nausicaa for  Larceny Scheme;  so Larceny
support is incomplete.

  *NOTE* The  last time the  author bothered to  update this
paragraph, it had tested SQLite Amalgamation version 3.6.19.

4. Install
----------

Be sure to have installed the Nausicaa/Scheme package first.
Read the "README.build" file for details on the installation
infrastructure.  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd SQLite
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-SQLite

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
