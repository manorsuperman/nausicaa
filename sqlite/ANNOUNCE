Notes for 2009-11-15 tag 0.1b0
------------------------------

* It  has  been  tested  with  SQLite  Amalgamation  version
  3.6.19.

* The  libraries  uncover a  bug  in  Mosh Scheme  (reported
  upstream)  which  manifests  itself with  the  SQLITE-EXEC
  function.  Avoding this API makes Mosh usable.
