1. Overview
-----------

Nausicaa/ScmObj  is  a repackaging  of  ScmObj, a  CLOS-like
object system  for Scheme implemented by  Dorai Sitaram.  It
offers a  programming environment, with  simple and multiple
inheritance and generic functions, but with *no* meta-object
protocol (MOP).

The code depends on the (srfi lists) library.

3. Install
----------

Basically you should do:

   $ cd scmobj
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-scmobj

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives and Slackware packages.


A. Credits
----------

ScmObj was  originally written  by Dorai Sitaram.   The code
has been ported to Ikarus, and swirled, by Marco Maggi.


B. Bug reports
--------------

It  seems  that  the  original  author  has  abandoned  this
project,  so  bug  reports   should  be  sent  by  email  to
<marcomaggi@gna.org>.
