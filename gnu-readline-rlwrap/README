1. Overview
-----------

This directory holds  a set of files to be  used to wrap the
Ikarus  Scheme  executable  with  the GNU  Readline  wrapper
Rlwrap by Hans  Lub.  The original version of  the files was
posted    to     the    Ikarus    Scheme     mailing    list
<ikarus-users@googlegroups.com>.

  The package is composed  by the Bourne shell script "ike",
which spawns  "rlwrap", and a set of  completion files.  The
script is  meant to be  installed in the "bin"  directory of
the user's home, while the completion files are concatenated
and installed in the single "~/.ikarus_completions" file.

  The installation  directories can be  changed by modifying
the variables in the "Makefile.custom" file.

  The "ike" script is  automatically generated by a template
"ike.in"  that  is  preprocessed  by  the  "Makefile".   The
template itself is meant to be customised at will.

3. Install
----------

This  installation  infrastructure  supports  only  the  GNU
system; which  means GNU Make,  GNU Bash and the  common GNU
command  line tools  (cp,  mv, mkdir,  ...).  The  following
rules are available in the "Makefile":

  all		build  the "ike"  script  from the  template
		"ike.in";

  clean		remove the "ike" script;

  install	install the script and the completion file;

  uninstall	uinstall the script and the completion file.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the fils under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper
