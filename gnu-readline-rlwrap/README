1. Overview
-----------

This directory holds  a set of files to be  used to wrap the
Ikarus  Scheme  executable  with  the GNU  Readline  wrapper
Rlwrap by  Hans Lub.   The original version  of some  of the
files  was   posted  to  the  Ikarus   Scheme  mailing  list
<ikarus-users@googlegroups.com>.

  The package is composed  by the Bourne shell script "ike",
which spawns  "rlwrap", and a set of  completion files.  The
script is  meant to be  installed in the "bin"  directory of
the   user's   home,   while   the  completion   files   are
concatenated, sorted, filtered  for uniqueness and installed
in the single "~/.ikarus_completions" file.

  The installation  directories can be  changed by modifying
the variables in the "Makefile".

  The "ike" script is  automatically generated by a template
"ike.in"  that  is  preprocessed  by  the  "Makefile".   The
template itself is meant to be customised at will.

3. Install
----------

The following rules are available:

  all		build  the "ike"  script  from the  template
		"ike.in"; build the completions file;

  clean		remove the "ike" script and the completions
                file;

  install	install the script and the completion file;

  uninstall	uninstall the script and the completion file.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper
