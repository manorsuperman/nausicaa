1. Overview
-----------

This directory holds  a set of files to be  used to wrap the
Ikarus  Scheme  executable  with  the GNU  Readline  wrapper
Rlwrap by  Hans Lub.   The original version  of some  of the
files  was   posted  to  the  Ikarus   Scheme  mailing  list
<ikarus-users@googlegroups.com>.

  Additionally support for Ypsilon Scheme is present.

  The package is composed  by the Bourne shell scripts "ike"
(for Ikarus) and "ype" for (Ypsilon) and a set of completion
files.  The scripts will spawn "rlwrap" with the appropriate
configuration and executable.

  The  scripts  are  meant  to  be installed  in  the  "bin"
directory of the user's home, while the completion files are
concatenated, sorted, filtered  for uniqueness and installed
as:

   .ikarus_completions
   .ypsilon_completions

in the user's home directory.

  The installation  directories can be  changed by modifying
the variables in the "Makefile".

  The  "ike" and "ype"  scripts are  automatically generated
from   the  templates   "ike.in"  and   "ype.in"   that  are
preprocessed by the "Makefile".  The template themselves are
meant to be customised at will.


2. License
----------

The files in this directory are in the public domain.


3. Install
----------

The following rules are available:

  all		build the scripts  from the templates; build
		the completions file;

  clean		remove the script and completion files;

  install	install the script and completion files;

  uninstall	uninstall the script and completion files.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper
