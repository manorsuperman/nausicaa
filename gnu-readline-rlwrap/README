1. Overview
-----------

This  directory holds  a set  of files  to be  used  to wrap
various  Scheme executables  with the  GNU  Readline wrapper
Rlwrap by  Hans Lub.   The original version  of some  of the
files  was   posted  to  the  Ikarus   Scheme  mailing  list
<ikarus-users@googlegroups.com>.

  Supports Larceny, Ypsilon and Ikarus.

  The package is composed  by the Bourne shell scripts "lay"
for Larceny, "ike"  for Ikarus, "ype" for Ypsilon  and a set
of completion  files.  The scripts will  spawn "rlwrap" with
the appropriate configuration and executable.

  The  scripts  are  meant  to  be installed  in  the  "bin"
directory of the user's home, while the completion files are
concatenated, sorted, filtered  for uniqueness and installed
as:

   .larceny_completions
   .ikarus_completions
   .ypsilon_completions

in the user's home directory.

  The installation  directories can be  changed by modifying
the variables in the "Makefile".

  The  "lay",  "ike"  and  "ype" scripts  are  automatically
generated from the templates "lay.in", "ike.in" and "ype.in"
that  are  preprocessed  by  the "Makefile".   The  template
themselves are meant to be customised at will.


2. License
----------

The files in this directory are in the public domain.


3. Install
----------

The following rules are available:

  all		build the scripts  from the templates; build
		the completions file;

  clean		remove the script and completion files;

  install	install the script and completion files;

  uninstall	uninstall the script and completion files.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper
