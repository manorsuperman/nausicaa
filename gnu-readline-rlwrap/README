1. Overview
-----------

This  directory holds  a set  of files  to be  used  to wrap
various  R6RS  Scheme  executables  with  the  GNU  Readline
wrapper Rlwrap,  by Hans Lub.  The original  version of some
of the  files was posted  to the Ikarus Scheme  mailing list
<ikarus-users@googlegroups.com>.

  Currently there  is support for Ikarus,  Larceny, Mosh and
Ypsilon.  The package is composed by:

lae - a Bourne shell script for Larceny
ike - a Bourne shell script for Ikarus
moe - a Bourne shell script for Mosh
ype - a Bourne shell script for Ypsilon

and  a set  of  completion files.   The  scripts will  spawn
"rlwrap" with the appropriate configuration and executable.

  The  scripts  are  meant  to  be installed  in  the  "bin"
directory of the user's home, while the completion files are
concatenated, sorted, filtered  for uniqueness and installed
as:

   .ikarus_completions
   .larceny_completions
   .mosh_completions
   .ypsilon_completions

in the user's home directory.

  The installation  directories can be  changed by modifying
the variables in the "Makefile".

  The   "ike",   "lae",   "moe"   and  "ype"   scripts   are
automatically   generated  from   the   templates  "ike.in",
"lae.in", "moe.in" and "ype.in" that are preprocessed by the
"Makefile".   The  template   themselves  are  meant  to  be
customised at will.
