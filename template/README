4. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

   $ cd template
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-template

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
