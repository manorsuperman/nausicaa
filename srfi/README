1. Overview
-----------

This  directory holds  implementations of  the  SRFI (Scheme
Request for Implementation) adapted to R6RS and Ikarus.  The
files are a checkout of the development version at Launchpad
(see   Resources),   with   the   only  change   being   the
normalisation of the library identifiers and file names.

  The current checkout is: revision 55.


2. License
----------

Each file has its own copyright notice at the top.  Refer to
it.


3. Install
----------

The  installation  infrastructure   supports  only  the  GNU
environment, which  means GNU Make, GNU Bash  and the common
command  line tools  (mv,  cp, mkdir,  ...).  The  following
rules are available in the "Makefile":

  all		compile all the installable Scheme files to
		the Ikarus FASL format;

  clean		remove the FASL files;

  install	install  the directories,  the  source files
		and the FASL files;

  uninstall	uinstall the  source and FASL  files, remove
		empty directories;

notice  that  to  correctly  uninstall  you  have  to  avoid
cleaning the source directory with "make clean".

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives and Slackware packages.


A. Bug reports
--------------

Bug reports about the SRFI code should be reported using the
Launchpad  interface.  Bug  reports about  this installation
infrastructure   are  welcome:   Send  them   by   email  to
<marcomaggi@gna.org>.
