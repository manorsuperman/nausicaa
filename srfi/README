1. Overview
-----------

This  directory holds  implementations of  the  SRFI (Scheme
Request for  Implementation).  The  files are a  checkout of
the development  version at Launchpad  (see Resources), with
the  only  change  being  the nomalisation  of  the  library
identifiers.

  The current checkout is: revision 55.


2. License
----------

Each file has its own copyright notice at the top.  Refer to
it.


3. Install
----------

The following rules are available in the "Makefile":

  all -		build the "ike" script from the
		template "ike.in";

  clean -	remove the "ike" script;

  install -	install the directories, the script and
		the completion files;

  uninstall -	uinstall the script, the completion files
		and the installation directories.

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the fils under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/ikarus-wrapper


A. Bug reports
--------------

Bug reports about the SRFI code should be reported using the
Launchpad  interface.  Bug  reports about  this installation
infrastructure   are  welcome:   Send  them   by   email  to
