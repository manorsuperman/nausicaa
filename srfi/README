1. Overview
-----------

This  directory holds  implementations of  the  SRFI (Scheme
Request for Implementation) adapted to R6RS and Ikarus.  The
files are a checkout of the development version at Launchpad
(see Resources)  by Derick  Eddington, with the  only change
being the normalisation of  the library identifiers and file
names.

  The current checkout is: revision 57.


2. License
----------

Each file has its own copyright notice at the top.  Refer to
it.


3. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

  $ mkdir "=build"
  $ cd "=build"
  $ ../configure
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-srfi

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Bug reports
--------------

Bug reports about the SRFI code should be reported to Derick
Eddington using the Launchpad interface.

Bug  reports  about  this  installation  infrastructure  are
welcome: Send them by email to <marcomaggi@gna.org>.


B. Resources
