1. Overview
-----------

This  directory holds  implementations of  the  SRFI (Scheme
Requests  for Implementation) adapted  to R6RS  Scheme.  The
files are a checkout of the development version at Launchpad
(see Resources) by  Derick Eddington.  Further modifications
where applied.   To assimilate the  libraries into Nausicaa,
library identifiers and file names have been normalised.


2. License
----------

Each file has its own copyright notice at the top.  Refer to
it.


3. Install
----------

We  should make  sure to  install Nausicaa/R6RS  before this
package.

  Basically we should do:

  $ cd srfi
  $ mkdir "=build"
  $ cd "=build"
  $ ../configure
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-srfi

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

The  original  SRFI  code  is  the  work  of  many  authors,
reference of which you can find the at the top of the source
code files.

  The  port  to  Ikarus  is  the work  of  Derick  Eddington
(<https://launchpad.net/~derick-eddington>).

  Nausicaa adaptation is by Marco Maggi.
