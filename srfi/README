1. Overview
-----------

This  directory holds  implementations of  the  SRFI (Scheme
Requests  for Implementation)  adapted to  R6RS  and Ikarus.
The  files are  a  checkout of  the  development version  at
Launchpad   (see  Resources)   by   Derick  Eddington.    To
assimilated the libraries into Nausicaa, library identifiers
and file names have been normalised.

  The current checkout is: revision 57.


2. License
----------

Each file has its own copyright notice at the top.  Refer to
it.


3. Install
----------

Basically we should do:

  $ cd srfi
  $ mkdir "=build"
  $ cd "=build"
  $ ../configure
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-srfi

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

The  original  SRFI  code  is  the  work  of  many  authors,
reference of which you can find the at the top of the source
code files.

  The  port  to  Ikarus  is  the work  of  Derick  Eddington
(<https://launchpad.net/~derick-eddington>).


B. Bug reports
--------------

Bug reports about the SRFI code should be reported to Derick
Eddington using the Launchpad interface.
