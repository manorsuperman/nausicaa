1. Introduction
---------------

This is  a distribution of Scheme libraries  for R6RS Scheme
implementations;  it implements  a binding  for the  Pango C
language  library.   It is  built  upon the  Nausicaa/Scheme
package, making use of its foreign-functions interface.

  Pango is a  library for laying out and  rendering of text,
with an emphasis on internationalization.  Pango can be used
anywhere that text layout is needed.

  Nausicaa/Pango  is currently  (Sat Oct  31,  2009) usable,
under  the  Nausicaa system,  only  with the  Nausicaa/Cairo
package,  a binding  for  the Cairo  graphics library.   The
package  supports  the   Ikarus,  Mosh  and  Ypsilon  Scheme
implementations; Larceny Scheme is not supported.

  Beware that upgading Pango to the latest version may break
your installed  programs (for example  GNU Emacs), so  it is
better to  stick with the version coming  with your system's
distribution.  The  last time the author  bothered to update
this paragraph, he had tested Pango version 1.26.0.

4. Install
----------

Be   sure  to   have  installed   the   Nausicaa/Scheme  and
Nausicaa/Cairo packages first.  Read the "README.build" file
for details on the installation infrastructure.

  Inspecting  the  Pango  headers requires  finding  various
installed files;  for a Pango installation  under the "/usr"
hierarchy, Pango's own headers are in:

    /usr/include/pango-1.0

but we need to find  the Glibc headers, too, which should be
under:

    /usr/include/glib-2.0

but we also need "glibconfig.h", which should be under:

    /usr/lib/glib-2.0/include

to locate all this  stuff, the "configure" script offers the
following options:

  --with-glib-includedir
  --with-glib-libincludedir
  --with-pango-includedir

which default to the values above.  Take your pick.

  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd pango
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure [... options ...]
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-pango

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.

  It appears  that Pango's main authors are  Owen Taylor and
