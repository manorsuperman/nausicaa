1. Introduction
---------------

This  file documents some  special Makefile  rules available
through  the  Nausicaa  packaging infrastructure.   For  the
build rules refer to the "README.build" files.

  All the packages in  the Nausicaa suite should support the
rules described here.


2. Compilation rules
--------------------

The compile  rules will compile all the  libraries under the
"<srcdir>/src/libraries" directory.  The following rules can
be invoked before installing the package.

ifasl - Compile the package libraries for Ikarus Scheme; the
	compiled  files will end  in the  currently selected
	Ikarus cache ("~/.ikarus" by default).

mfasl - Compile the  package libraries for  Mosh Scheme; the
        compiled  files will end  in the  currently selected
        Mosh cache ("~/.mosh" by default).

yfasl - Compile  the package  libraries for  Ypsilon Scheme;
        the  compiled  files   will  end  in  the  currently
        selected Mosh cache ("~/.mosh" by default).

fasl -	Compile the package's  libraries for all the enabled
	Scheme   implementations.   It   is   equivalent  to
	executing all the rules above.

  The following  rules must be invoked  after installing the
package.

ifasl-installed -
	Compile the package's libraries for Ikarus Scheme in
	their installation location; the compiled files will
	end   in  the   currently   selected  Ikarus   cache
	("~/.ikarus" by default).

mfasl-installed -
	Compile the  package's libraries for  Mosh Scheme in
        their installation location; the compiled files will
        end in the  currently selected Mosh cache ("~/.mosh"
        by  default).

yfasl-installed -
	Compile the package  libraries for Ypsilon Scheme in
        their installation location; the compiled files will
        end in the  currently selected Mosh cache ("~/.mosh"
        by default).

fasl-installed -
	Compile the package's  libraries for all the enabled
	Scheme   implementations   in   their   installation
	location.   It is  equivalent to  executing  all the
	"-installed" rules above.


3. Testing rules
----------------

The  test rules  will run  all the  test programs  under the
"<srcdir>/tests"  directory.   The  following rules  can  be
invoked before installing the package.

itest - Test the package libraries for Ikarus Scheme.

mtest - Test the package libraries for Mosh Scheme.

ytest - Test the package libraries for Ypsilon Scheme.

test  - Test  the package's  libraries for  all  the enabled
	Scheme implementations.

  The following  rules must be invoked  after installing the
package.

itest-installed -
	Test  the package's libraries  for Ikarus  Scheme in
	their  installation location.

mtest-installed -
	Test  the  package's libraries  for  Mosh Scheme  in
	their installation location.

ytest-installed -
	Test  the package  libraries for  Ypsilon  Scheme in
        their installation location.

test-installed -
	Test  the package's  libraries for  all  the enabled
	Scheme   implementations   in   their   installation
	location.
