1. Introduction
---------------

This  is a  distribution  of Scheme  language libraries  for
Ikarus Scheme.


1.1 About 'Nausicaa'
--------------------

If  you  are  wondering   why  this  distribution  is  named
Nausicaa, you  may enjoy reading the manga  "Nausicaa of the
Valley of the  Wind" by Master Hayao Miyazaki,  or watch its
movie.

  You may also  find interesting what the crazy  guys of the
OpenSky project are trying to do:

2. License
----------

Each project in this distribution has its own license notice
and copyright  assignment.  You must look  in the individual
directories for  the COPYING  file, and occasionally  at the
top of each  file, where there is a  specific license notice
and copyright assignment.


3. Installation
---------------

The Nausicaa  installation infrastructure supports  only GNU
systems.   This  means  Unix   like  systems  in  which  the
following common tools and packages are installed: GNU Bash,
GNU Make, GNU coreutils, GNU tar, Gzip, Bzip2.

  There are 2 sources of informations about the installation
of  a Nausicaa  project: the  individual,  project specific,
README files; the  Nausicaa overall documentation in Texinfo
format, which is available in the "doc" subdirectory.

  For you  own safety, take this advice:  never, ever, drive
building  and  installation  of  packages  from  the  source
directory  of a  project; always  create a  subdirectory and
move into it:

   $ cd <source-directory-of-project>
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"

then, usually, you should do:

   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  Notice that:

* by default only documentation  in Info format is built and
  installed,  documentation  in HTML  format  is pruned;  to
  change  this  use  the  '--enable-doc-html'  configuration
  option.

  There is  basic support for package  creation, for example
for Slackware; read the Nausicaa documentation for details.


A. Credits
----------

Scheme is  a statically scoped  and properly tail--recursive
dialect  of the  Lisp programming  language invented  by Guy
Lewis Steele Jr. and Gerald Jay Sussman.  It was designed to
have  an exceptionally  clear and  simple semantics  and few
different ways to form expressions.

  The "Revised^6 Report  on the Algorithmic Language Scheme"
gives  a defining  description of  the  programming language
Scheme.  The report is the work of many people in the course
of many  years.  Revision 6  was edited by  Michael Sperber,
R. Kent Dybvig, Matthew Flatt and Anton Van Straaten.

  Ikarus is  an R6RS compliant implementation  of the Scheme
programming  language.   It  is  the creation  of  Abdulaziz
Ghuloum (<http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/>).

  Several libraries depend upon  the port to R6RS and Ikarus
of  the  Scheme  Requests  For Implementation  (SRFI).   The
original SRFI code is the work of many authors, reference of
which you can find the at  the top of the source code files;
the  port  to  Ikarus   is  the  work  of  Derick  Eddington
(<https://launchpad.net/~derick-eddington>).

  The Nausicaa  distribution and installation infrastructure
is the  creation of Marco  Maggi (<marcomaggi@gna.org>).  If
this work  exists, it is  because of the GNU  Software tools
that he uses all the time.

  For other  credits notes  look in the  individual, project
specific, REAME files.
  

B. Bug reports
--------------

See  the instructions in  the individual,  project specific,
README  files.   Bugs  regarding the  Nausicaa  installation
infrastructure    should    be     sent    by    email    to
<marcomaggi@gna.org>.
