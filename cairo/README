1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a  distribution of libraries for R6RS Scheme
implementations;  it  provides  bindings  for the  Cairo  2D
graphics library.

  It  is  built  upon  Nausicaa/Scheme, making  use  of  its
foreign  functions interface; it  supports Ikarus,  Mosh and
Ypsilon  Scheme  and it  currently  supports only  GNU+Linux
systems.

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph,  he had tested  Cairo version  1.8.10 (previously
1.8.8) and Pixman version 0.17.10 (previously 0.16.2).

4. Install
----------

4.1 Install Pixman
------------------

Unpack the archive:

  $ tar --extract --gzip --file=pixman-0.16.2.tar.gz

then it should be the usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


4.2 Install Cairo
------------------

Unpack the archive:

  $ tar --extract --gzip --file=cairo-1.8.8.tar.gz

then it should be the usual:

  $ ./configure
  $ make
  $ make check
  $ make install


4.3 Install Nausicaa/Cairo
--------------------------

Be sure to have installed the Nausicaa/Scheme package first.
Read the "README.build" file for details on the installation
infrastructure.  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd nausicaa-cairo
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-cairo

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
