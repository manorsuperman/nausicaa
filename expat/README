1. Introduction
---------------

This package is a  distribution of libraries for R6RS Scheme
implementations;  it  provides  bindings  for  the  Expat  C
language library, an XML parser library.

  It  is  built  upon  Nausicaa/Scheme, making  use  of  its
foreign-functions interface.   It supports Ikarus,  Mosh and
Ypsilon   Scheme;  the   package   infrastructure  currently
supports only GNU+Linux systems.

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph, he had tested Expat version 2.0.1.

4. Install
----------

Be sure to have installed the Nausicaa/Scheme package first.
Read the "README.build" file for details on the installation
infrastructure.  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd expat
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-expat

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

The stuff was written by Marco Maggi.

  Expat is the creation of  James Clark, who's also given us
groff (an nroff look-alike),  Jade (an implemention of ISO's
DSSSL stylesheet  language for SGML), XP (a  Java XML parser
package),  XT  (a Java  XSL  engine).   James  was also  the
technical lead on the XML Working Group at W3C that produced
the XML specification.
