1. Introduction
---------------

This is an  interface to the Expat library  for R6RS Scheme.
Expat is a library, written in C, for parsing XML documents.
It's the  underlying XML parser for the  open source Mozilla
project, Perl's XML::Parser, Python's xml.parsers.expat, and
other open-source XML parsers.

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph, he had tested Expat version 2.0.1.

4. Install
----------

Be sure  to have installed  the Nausicaa/R6RS, Nausicaa/SRFI
and Nausicaa/Uriel libraries first.

  Basically we should do:

   $ cd expat
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-expat

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.


A. Credits
----------

The stuff was written by Marco Maggi.

  Expat is the creation of  James Clark, who's also given us
groff (an nroff look-alike),  Jade (an implemention of ISO's
DSSSL stylesheet  language for SGML), XP (a  Java XML parser
package),  XT  (a Java  XSL  engine).   James  was also  the
technical lead on the XML Working Group at W3C that produced
the XML specification.
