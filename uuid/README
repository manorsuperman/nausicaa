1. Introduction
---------------

Nausicaa/UUID is a distribution of libraries for R6RS Scheme
impmentations;  it provides  a  binding to  OSSP UUID.   The
package  is built  upon Nausicaa/Scheme,  making use  of its
foreign functions interface.

  OSSP  UUID   is  an  ISO-C:1999   application  programming
interface  (API) and  corresponding  command line  interface
(CLI) for the generation  of DCE 1.1, ISO/IEC 11578:1996 and
IETF  RFC  4122   compliant  Universally  Unique  Identifier
(UUID).

  *NOTE* The  last time the  author bothered to  update this
paragraph he had tested UUID version 1.6.2.

4. Install
----------

4.1 Install OSSP UUID
---------------------

Do:

    $ tar xvzf uuid-1.4.2.tar.gz
    $ cd uuid-1.4.2
    $ ./configure --enable-shared --disable-static
    $ make
    $ make install


4.2 Install Nausicaa/UUID
-------------------------

Be sure to have installed the Nausicaa/Scheme package first.
Read the "README.build" file for details on the installation
infrastructure.  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd uuid
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-uuid

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
