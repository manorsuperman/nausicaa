1. Introduction
---------------

This is  a distribution of Scheme libraries  for R6RS Scheme
implementations; it provides bindings for the GNU Libiconv C
language  library.   It is  built  upon the  Nausicaa/Scheme
package, making use of its foreign-functions interface.

  GNU Libiconv converts text between encodings.

  The package  supports the Ikarus, Mosh  and Ypsilon Scheme
implementations; Larceny Scheme is not supported.

  The  last   time  the  author  bothered   to  update  this
paragraph, he had tested GNU Libiconv version 1.13.1.

4. Install
----------

Be sure to have installed the Nausicaa/Scheme package first.
Read the "README.build" file for details on the installation
infrastructure.  Basically we should do:

   $ cd <nausicaa top>
   $ cd iconv
   $ mkdir "=build"
   $ cd "=build"
   $ ../configure
   $ make
   $ make test
   $ make install

  To test what a rule will do use the "-n" option; example:

    $ make install -n

  The "Makefile" supports the "DESTDIR" environment variable
to install the files under a temporary location; example:

    $ make install DESTDIR=/tmp/marco/nausicaa-iconv

  The   "Makefile"  supports  the   packages  infrastructure
described  in the  Nausicaa documentation.   Refer to  it to
build binary distribution archives.
